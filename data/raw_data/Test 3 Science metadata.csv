To gain insight into the problem, library instruction environments of nineteen high schools were explored. The schools were selected based on whether their graduates did well or poorly on information-skills assignments integrated in a required first-year college course. The librarians in the nineteen schools were asked to characterize their working relationships with teachers, estimate their students' information-literacy achievement, and provide data on their staffing and budgets. Findings suggest that school librarians are seldom in a position to adequately collaborate with teachers and that their opportunities to help students achieve information literacy are limited.

In this paper we report on the first phase of a discipline-specific academic writing project at King's College London. The instructional approach takes as its starting point the assessed academic genres which students have to write. Working within the tradition of genre based approaches to academic writing instruction, we have used the KCL Apprentice Writing Corpus to provide a databank of exemplars. These texts, along with grading and feedback information from academic departments, and input from disciplinary specialists, have provided the basis for discipline-specific writing courses which focus on strategically important assessed disciplinary genres (Critical Assignments in Applied Linguistics, and Laboratory Reports in Pharmacy). In this paper we discuss issues in corpus compilation, the selection of exemplars, and the rationale which has informed the development of the teaching resources. We also provide examples from the workshops offered as part of the courses. The paper concludes with a brief account of the evaluation of the courses, and a discussion of how corpus informed materials are being developed to extend the project in its second phase.","2013","2018-06-20 13:30:21","2020-01-24 15:28:50","","307-321","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many librarians still struggle to solidify their place, and their value, in the instructional landscape of their parent institution. This struggle persists while library instruction for students remains limited to one 50-75 min session (one-shot instruction). Indeed, the notion that information literacy can be taught in one session is preposterous for most librarians. Nevertheless, as this constraint persists, librarians must work to improve the results students achieve within the one-shot model. This research explores ways in which one-shot library instruction might be bolstered through the promotion of higher levels of student engagement. This research utilizes a pre and post-test analytical model to compare an experimental, learner-centered approach to library instruction, supplemented with clickers, to a more traditional pedagogical approach. Statistical analyses show that while both the experimental and control groups witnessed significant improvement from pre to post-test, there was no statistically significant difference between these two approaches. These findings elicit further, perhaps more troubling, questions regarding the level of engagement possible in one-shot library instruction.

This quasi-experimental study assessed four pedagogical approaches for single or multi-session ILI. The conventional approach, which involves lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on time, was used in both the control and the experimental groups. The three experimental groups involved: (a) assigning students to preview the class Research Guide and take a graded quiz (Preview group), (b) engaging interactively with students during the ILI session (Active Learning group), and (c) providing multiple instruction and follow-up sessions (Multi-session group). A different pretest and posttest based on the first two ACRL Information Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) were developed for assessment. The results showed that student knowledge of concepts included in the training improved significantly in both the control and the experimental groups, but no differences were found among the teaching methods employed. The qualitative analysis revealed that the professor in the Preview group who integrated IL cohesively in her assignments experienced more satisfactory learning outcomes. The overall low scores suggest that more powerful instruction strategies besides diversified pedagogies are needed to significantly enhance long-term retention.","2014","2018-06-20 13:30:22","2019-11-13 21:54:05","","234-246","","3–4","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through core courses such as Information Organization, Information Seeking, and Information Technology, students “dive deep” into the content of a particular part of the field and learn the complex aspects of information practice. This emphasis on content separated into “core” courses can have the unintended consequence of making it difficult for students to integrate course content into their broader understanding of the profession. This two-part column explores the use of curriculum integrated with cloud-based instructional technology resources to create an active and hands-on setting that also helps students see relationships and interconnected aspects of information work. In discussing this approach, the author explores issues of student technology literacy and learning fatigue and discusses a technical framework for implementing technology-rich integrated curricula using a cloud-based virtual computing lab platform that maximizes positive aspects of an integrated curriculum while avoiding downsides associated with teaching in technology-rich settings.

Careful and thorough instruction in the mining of popular Internet search engines for authoritative information was coupled with instruction in the use of traditional library resources. It was found that the college students studied possess a high need for clarity and a low tolerance for ambiguity, and therefore any activities assigned must be thoroughly, yet succinctly, described in order to achieve success.

Early observations indicate that undergraduate students in particular may need instruction in the selection, navigation, and use of electronic resources if they are to benefit from them. Subject areas such as chemistry, which have long traditions of undergraduate library instruction, are well positioned to extend instruction to the digital sphere. Most sciences, including the geosciences, however, have weaker traditions upon which to draw. How then does a geoscience library proceed to meet user needs and do so preferably on a programmatic basis?

The goals of the research were to identify which of the information literacy standards for science, engineering and technology were addressed in the tutorials, and the extent that the tutorials incorporated good pedagogical elements. Methods - The researcher chose for review 31 of the tutorials selected by members of the ACRL Science & Technology Section (STS) Information Literacy Committee. She carefully analyzed the tutorials and developed a database with codes for the topic of each tutorial, the STS information literacy standard(s) addressed by the tutorial, and whether good pedagogical elements were incorporated. The entire analysis and coding procedure was repeated three times to ensure consistency. Results - The tutorials analyzed in this study covered various subjects and addressed all the (STS) information literacy standards. The tutorials presented information clearly and allowed users to select their own learning paths. The incorporation of good pedagogical elements was limited, especially in relation to active learning elements. Conclusions - Web tutorials have been accepted as effective information literacy instruction tools and have been used to teach all elements of the STS information literacy standards. Yet, ensuring they provide a real learning experience for students remains a challenge. More serious thought needs to be given to integrating good pedagogy into these instructional tools in order to attain deep learning.

It was determined that a technical writing class focusing on the geosciences was needed. Dr. Mary Kraus was the leading proponent of this and enlisted the Head of the Earth Sciences Library to help design and co-teach the class with her. The class, Writing in the Geosciences, is required for an undergraduate geology degree. While the class has changed through the years with several different Geological Sciences faculty co-teaching, the information literacy component, focusing on research strategies, critical thinking regarding the validity of information retrieved, and knowledge of bibliographic databases, has remained a mainstay. The current faculty member teaching the class, Dr. Henrietta Laustsen, has done so for several years and works closely with the librarian organizing the syllabus and designing assignments, taking into account comments from previous class members on course evaluations. Building a resume, as a writing assignment, is also a part of the class and is taught by the librarian.

There are a number of factors leading to this paradigm shift. They include the continued growth in the number of published scientific papers, the escalating costs of acquiring these publications--especially journals, significantly expanded access to and delivery of information through computer networks, changes in the pattern of scholarly communication, and new directions in policies and funding for libraries. These changes will have major ramifications for libraries as well as the producers and consumers of geoscience information. Libraries are acquiring an ever diminishing proportion of the international geoscience literature at the same time that scholars, researchers and practitioners have gained unbridled access to these information sources as well as a multitude of scientific data sets. This paper examines the impacts and implications of these changes and the development of new models that emphasize the role of libraries as providers of value-added information services and suppliers of just-in-time information resources.

We study the relationships among topography, geology, and available erosion rates in space and time to place constraints on plausible canyon incision histories. Evidence suggests that lateral retreat of the Shivwits Plateau escarpment left a lithologically controlled bench on the Sanup Plateau, but the Hualapai Plateau is beveled indiscriminately across rock types of the Paleozoic stratigraphic section. A period of accelerated base-level fall in the Tertiary is implicated by the canyon incised into the beveled Hualapai Plateau surface, consistent with higher erosion rates observed in canyons than on the surrounding plateau. Streams draining the Hualapai Plateau preserve relict headwater segments that were equilibrated with a slower base-level-fall rate before canyon incision. These relict segments are now separated from the Grand Canyon by knickpoints indicative of a transient landscape. Relief production since the beveling of the Hualapai Plateau is ~1000 m in the WGC. Comparison of hillslope and channel morphologies between the Grand Wash Cliffs and the WGC provides a test to distinguish hypothesized ages of canyon incision. The data strongly suggest that carving of the WGC is younger than relief production due to slip on the Grand Wash fault ca. 18-12 Ma. Thus the geomorphic data are only fully consistent with the late Tertiary, transient incision model of canyon incision beginning at integration after 6 Ma.

We find that contrary to the vertical pattern of occupational stratification implied by the ""glass escalator,"" men are not disproportionately represented in administrative posts. Instead, we find a pervasive pattern of horizontal sex segregation, whereby men and women are disproportionately clustered in particular gendered specialties. Using in-depth interviews with a sample of registered nurses, we show that male nurses tend to gravitate toward areas of nursing they perceive to be more ""masculine."" Our findings have implications for other female-dominated occupations because the bottom-heavy structure of most occupations limits the number of men (as well as women) from reaching the top positions within the field, meaning that horizontal sorting processes of acclimation sort most male employees in female-dominated professions.","2008-05","2018-06-20 13:44:45","2018-06-20 13:44:45","","271-299","","2","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 100 library users were unobtrusively observed in the Kent State University Library to determine if they exhibit a gender bias when seeking assistance. During the course of this study, library users were confronted with a choice of both a male or female librarian to approach at the reference desk.

One name that appears to be gaining currency is ""Millennials,"" perhaps as a way to better differentiate the current generation from its predecessor, Generation X. Millennials are those individuals born between 1982 and 2002, give or take a couple of years. They represent a generation that began to spill onto college and university campuses at the turn of the millennium and have already had a subtle–and sometimes not so subtle–impact on campus space. Millennials now influence space planning, design, and construction and will continue to transform higher education as they return to campus as faculty and staff. The Baby Boomers have garnered much of the press in recent years given their sheer numbers, although people were clearly reminded by Tom Brokaw of the incalculable contributions of the G.I. or ""Greatest"" Generation. How do the Millennials fit into the historical constellation of generations? Although an entire generation cannot be uniformly categorized, it is clear that generational cohorts have some values and traits in common given their shared social and historical experiences. The dividing dates between cohorts are not rigid–and, indeed, individuals on the generational ""cusps"" share traits from neighboring generations–but there is rough agreement regarding how these cohorts are distributed over time. In this article, the author provides brief descriptions of the four generations immediately preceding the Millennial Generation: (1) ""The G.I. Generation"" (born 1901 to 1924); (2) ""The Silent Generation"" (born 1925 to 1942); (3) ""The Boomer Generation"" (born 1943 to 1960); and (4) ""Generation X"" (born 1961 to 1981). The author also discusses the characteristics of the millennial generation.","2010","2018-06-20 13:44:45","2018-06-20 13:44:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>SO: New England Journal of Higher Education; Jun 2010; LV: Higher Education</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conventional explanation for wage gap-job segregation-is incorrect because it ignores men's incentive to preserve their advantages and their ability to do so by establishing the rules that distribute rewards. The primary method through which all dominant groups maintain their hegemony is by differentiating the subordinate group and defining it as inferior and hence meriting inferior treatment. My argument implies that neither sex-integrating jobs nor implementing comparable worth will markedly improve women's employment status because men can subvert these mechanisms or even change the rules by which rewards are allocated. As evidence, I show that occupational integration has failed to advance women appreciably, and I argue that comparable worth is not likely to be much more effective.

In particular it focuses on the dynamics of career entry, career orientation (namely, a preference for intrinsic or extrinsic rewards) and the possible existence, nature and consequences of role strain. Four occupational groups are examined: nurses, cabin crew, librarians and primary school teachers. The results suggest that men fall into three main categories: seekers (who actively chose the 'female' occupation), 'finders' (who did not actively seek a non-traditional career but who found the occupation in the process of making general career decisions) and settlers (who actively chose the occupation, often as a result of dissatisfaction with a more 'masculine' job, and who then settled in their non-traditional career). Settlers, in particular, are associated with a more intrinsic career orientation and express a desire to remain close to occupational and professional practice. Role strain is prevalent in men's experiences in their nontraditional career. The potential sources of such role strain and the implications for career aspirations and career choices are explored.

Understanding generational shifts is especially important given the coming retirement of Baby Boomer workers and their replacement by those born after 1982 (GenMe/GenY/Millennials). Findings: Most studies, including the few time-lag studies, show that GenX and especially GenMe rate work as less central to their lives, value leisure more, and express a weaker work ethic than Boomers and Silents. Extrinsic work values (e.g., salary) are higher in GenMe and especially GenX. Contrary to popular conceptions, there were no generational differences in altruistic values (e.g., wanting to help others). Conflicting results appeared in desire for job stability, intrinsic values (e.g., meaning), and social/affiliative values (e.g., making friends). GenX, and especially GenMe are consistently higher in individualistic traits. Overall, generational differences are important where they appear, as even small changes at the average mean that twice or three times as many individuals score at the top of the distribution. Implications: To recruit GenMe, companies should focus on work–life balance issues and flexible schedules. Programs based on volunteering, altruistic values, social values, or meaning in work will likely be no more successful than they were for previous generations. The lack of generational differences in job hopping suggests that GenMe workers who are satisfied will be retained. Originality/value: No previous review has summarized all of the available studies examining generational differences in work values.

"FAQ6DAWF","journalArticle","1998","Winter, Michael","Garlic, Vodka, And The Politics Of Gender: Anti-intellectualism in American Librarianship","Progressive Librarian","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/207670199?accountid=14692","The topic may seem surprising, because librarians are so obviously intellectual, or at least bookish, athough they have been called, perhaps unfairly, enemies of books (Adams 1937). They are, to use Seymour Martin Lipset's nice neutral phrase, culture distributors (Lipset 1981: 333). But as Richard Hofstadter pointed out in his famous 1963 book, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, intellectuals sometimes show a fundamental hostility to the life of the mind, even though it is allegedly more common in people of action. No one is startled when executives denounce the study of history as a waste of time, or when politicians ridicule the efforts of scholars to understand human behavior (Shaffer 1977). Nonetheless, intellectuals occasionally do this too, and sometimes writers duke it out in publishers' offices. Indeed, it may be one of the favorite occupations of the intellectual classes to show occasionally their anti-intellectualism as a kind of badge of authenticity to the gatekeepers of mass culture. Recently David Bromwich (1996), has suggested that part of the heritage of McCarthyism - a favorite subject of Hofstadter's also - is the internalization of this hostility (see also Woolf 1964). Typical signs of CWS include the Board Room Look, admiration for glossy magazines reporting the brave exploits and huge salaries of CEOs, an excessive preoccupation with image, much emphasis on official secrecy, and a deep-rooted suspicion of reflective thought. Other observable symptoms can also be noted by the alert diagnostician and fall into familiar categories. I've collected a few of these over the years. Job security is for wimps, I once heard a tenured administrator say. But my personal favorite is: I can't meet with you on Thursday afternoons because that's when I get my massage. Consider also certain typical behaviors (moving freely throughout a large organization but requiting all visitors to one's own space to run a gauntlet of clerical gatekeepers while publicly announcing an open door policy); occupying palatial private offices overlooking deep green lawns and tree-lined quads while herding others into windowless cubicles that allow for easy surveillance of their activities; and of course the economic benefit of a salary which is only three or four times the average employee's income. And don't forget the stale and self-serving observations about how executives make so much more in the corporate sector. Dee Garrison's work reminded us that this was part of a larger feminization of American culture in our recent past. In some of the more recent work on librarianship and gender, there is a suggestion that the feminization process may have peaked and perhaps even reversed (Williams 1995). And of course this reversal, if that is what it is, is linked to the coming of new technologies, in ways that writers like Roma Harris have indicated. In her book Librarianship: The Erosion of a Women's Profession this is discussed at some length, and can best be summarized here by her use of Michael Gorman's observation that an information scientist is a man who doesn't want to be called a librarian (Gorman 1990: 463; Harris 1992: 36). This suggests that our dislike of ideas and theory, and our current fascination with corporate culture, may be more than temporary spasms of anti-intellectualism; they may also indicate some seismic shifting of what have been, for the last hundred years, the foundations of our gender politics.","1998","2018-06-20 13:44:49","2018-06-20 13:44:49","","5","","14","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright Durland Alternatives Library Apr 30, 1998; DOCID: 507321281; PCID: 8490401; PMID: 58672; ProvJournalCode: PVLN; AccNum: SFLNSPVLN0901PXDR873000012; PublisherXID: SFLNSPVLN0901PXDR873000012</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research finds that subtle aspects of the interactions, norms, and expectations in women's professions push men upward and outward into the higher-status, higher-paying, more ""masculine"" positions within these fields. Although most research includes minority men, little has explicitly considered how racial dynamics color these men's encounters with the mechanisms of the glass escalator. In this article, the author examines how intersections of race and gender combine to shape experiences for minority men in the culturally feminized field of nursing and finds that the upward mobility implied by the glass escalator is not uniformly available to all men who do ""women's work."" The author concludes that the glass escalator is a racialized concept and a gendered one and considers the implications of this for future studies of men in feminized occupations.","2009-02","2018-06-20 13:44:50","2018-06-20 13:44:50","","5-26","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Special attention is paid to how race and class shape the experience of discrimination for these groups. Topics discussed are wide-ranging and include: gender discrimination and the wage gap; sexual minorities (LGBT workers); homophobic and ""gay friendly"" workplaces; sexual harassment; sex in the workplace; sex work and sex workers; gender equity policies; transgender workers; men and women in non-traditional jobs; occupational gender segregation; and gender difference in work hours.

Twenty years ago, I introduced the concept of the “glass escalator,” my term for the advantages that men receive in the so-called women’s professions (nursing, teaching, librarianship, and social work), including the assumption that they are better suited than women for leadership positions. In this article, I revisit my original analysis and identify two major limitations of the concept: (1) it fails to adequately address intersectionality; in particular, it fails to theorize race, sexuality, and class; and (2) it was based on the assumptions of traditional work organizations, which are undergoing rapid transformation in our neoliberal era. The glass escalator assumes stable employment, career ladders, and widespread support for public institutions (e.g., schools and libraries)—which no longer characterize the job market today. Drawing on my studies of the oil and gas industry and the retail industry, I argue that new concepts are needed to understand workplace gender inequality in the 21st century.","2013-06-11","2018-06-20 13:44:50","2018-10-26 20:24:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; issn: print 0891-2432; issn: electronic 1552-3977; publication_type: full_text</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study provided practical research to better equip employers working with Millennials. Business leaders were interviewed from both the public and private sector. Results from the interviews were compiled and revealed recurrent themes on the Millennial working population. Analysis of the interview responses revealed detailed descriptions of Millennials in the workplace however, business leaders acknowledged fewer practical techniques to recruit, retain, and manage the Millennials. Common themes surrounding the generation consisted of maturity, motivation, work ethic, productivity, self-confidence, social skills, teams, learning and technology. To get the best from the generation, business leaders are in a position to use the results of the study to bridge the generational differences in today's workforce. It will be important for the Millennial generation to take on an active role in co-constructing techniques with business leaders to recruit, retain, and manage the generation. A defined structure, with constant supervision will need to be offered to empower and retain Millennial employees.

Demographic comparison with other academic librarians suggests participants may reflect a larger population. Work life content and context consists of tasks performed; technological and work systems; working conditions and securities; work setting; and beliefs, values, and preferences. The constant comparative method (grounded theory) was chosen because it allows (1) use of open-ended questions and face-to-face interactions for participant-driven data; (2) flexibility in data collection, coding, and analysis–necessary for identifying similarities, differences, and consistencies of meaning across emerging concepts; and (3) acknowledgement of the researcher's previous experience in similar work settings. Findings demonstrate that, as a group, these librarians engage in collection, catalog, reference, and learning-teaching-training work. Librarians define their work as ""primarily"" one of the first three; the fourth emerges from the data as a distinct kind of work. Librarians give greatest importance to primary work in a literal and conceptual sense. This work concept governs how they think, give order to each day, assign roles, determine the size of their work world, and define a sense of ""place"" and ""fit"" within life-at-work. In pictoral terms, librarians place primary work in the foreground, followed by colleagues. Less strongly depicted are library system-related matters (like policy, management, communication, loyalty, and responsibility); very few university images are visible. Participants see academic librarianship as providing a professional identity associated with learning, teaching, and scholarship. They prefer as colleagues those who also approach work as thinkwork and puzzle-solving. They prefer users who learn to independently manipulate a library while working with librarians to master new information or knowledge-seeking techniq (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)","1996","2018-06-20 13:44:53","2018-06-20 13:44:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>SO: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences Vol 56(11-A), 1996, pp. 4188; OJ: Dissertation Abstracts International; FC: Print; ME: Empirical Study; AE: Adulthood (18 yrs &amp; older); LR: 19960101 (PsycINFO)</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relying on both qualitative and quantitative data, the authors seek to link social scientific ideas about workers’ lives, sex inequality, and gender to the real-world workplace. This new edition contains updated statistics, timely cartoons, and presents new scholarship in the field. It also provides a renewed focus on reasons for variability in inequality across workplaces. In sum, the second edition of Women and Men at Work presents a contemporary perspective to the field, with relevant comparative and historical insights that will draw readers in and connect them to the wider concern of making sense of our dramatically changing world. 0","2002","2018-06-20 13:44:53","2018-10-26 20:19:50","","","232","","","","","","","","","","Pine Forge Press","Thousand Oaks, CA","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Paperback</p>; <p>id: 1; Binding: Paperback</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2nd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"N6PG65ZH","thesis","1998","Ostrow, Rona L.","LIBRARY CULTURE IN THE ELECTRONIC AGE: A CASE STUDY OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE","","","","","","Libraries have undergone a remarkable transformation in the past 20 years due, in large part, to the introduction of computer-based information technologies. This ethnographic case study of an academic library in the age of electronic information focuses on organizational culture and organizational change. Organizational culture is defined as the shared, interactive, recreative pattern of intrinsic factors (such as beliefs, values, assumptions and ideologies) as manifested in extrinsic factors (such as language, behaviors, espoused values, and artifacts) of a group of people, constructed over time, as the result of their social interaction. Cultures provide members with meaning, anxiety reduction, and a way of interpreting new developments in terms of the old; as such, they are inherently conservative and resistant to change. In order to give voice to multiple viewpoints, the library was studied from the three perspective framework developed by Joanne Martin and Debra E. Meyerson; it includes integration, differentiation, and fragmentation views of the library's culture. The integration study focuses on consensus and examines a dominant culture of reference and instruction which took shape in the presence of information technology; the culture serves to intensify the teaching role of the librarians and enhance their faculty status. The differentiation study focuses on dissensus and demonstrates that the introduction of technology has also engendered several subcultures; two of these, the systems support team subculture and the branch librarians' subculture are described at length. Finally, the fragmentation view uncovers the anxieties and ambiguities experienced by organization members which arise from concerns about the future of librarianship; faculty status; relationships with students, faculty, and other stakeholders; and the possibility of deprofessionalization, Transformational leadership and power relationships play major roles in the ongoing enactment of the culture. The study addresses matters of immediate and vital concern to academic administrators, librarians, library educators, and anyone concerned with the social implications of computers in the workplace.","1998","2018-06-20 13:44:53","2018-06-20 13:44:53","","","267-2766","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Degree: PH.D.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is universal agreement on the Baby Boomer generation (1946-1964) and most people agree that Generation X started in 1965 and ended around 1979, after that it gets murky. In his research, the author believes that the ""Net [Internet] Generation"" started in 1980. Others have called this Generation Y, Millennial Generation, and Generation M, but he thinks the defining feature has always been the importance of the Internet in the lives of these children, teens, and young adults. Right behind the Net Generation is the ""iGeneration"" named after all the devices with an ""i""–iPod, iPhone, iTouch, iEverything–plus these children's thirst for any new mobile technology. Children have grown up in an environment where technology is everywhere and much of it is invisible. In this article, the author looks at specific media activities of the younger generation and describes how media use research helps in understanding how best to educate and parent the youth. The author emphasizes the role of educators in providing an educational experience to this generation of media-immersed, tech-savvy students.","2010","2018-06-20 13:44:55","2018-06-20 13:44:55","","8-12","","8","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ880884</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Questionnaire data are used to examine whether female physicians are socially integrated in the male-dominated profession of medicine in terms of the support they receive from their medical colleagues compared to male physicians. The literature on tokenism and homophily suggests that women in male-dominated professions receive less support than their male colleagues, whereas the social support literature predicts that women typically receive more emotional support than men but less informational and instrumental support. The results of this study shed light on the complex and multi-layered ways in which gender is relevant to our understanding of the extent to which co-workers provide empathy, information and assistance to one another.","2013","2018-06-20 13:44:55","2018-06-20 13:44:55","","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fewer studies, however, explore the implications of women in leadership positions for the opportunities and experiences of subordinates. Do women leaders serve to undo the gendered organization? In other words, is women’s greater representation in leadership positions associated with less gender segregation at lower organizational levels? We explore this question by drawing on Cohen and Huffman’s (2007) conceptual framework of women leaders as either “change agents” or “cogs in the machine” and analyze a unique multilevel data set of workplaces nested within Fortune 1000 firms. Our findings generally support the “agents of change” perspective. Women’s representation among corporate boards of directors, corporate executives, and workplace managers is associated with less workplace gender segregation. Hence, it appears that women’s access to organizational power helps to undo the gendered organization.","2016-02-01","2018-06-20 13:44:56","2018-06-20 13:44:56","","109-135","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines the effectiveness of a course like this as an intervention to the normative landscape of the Library and Information Science (LIS) field that often privileges White, male, middle-class, heterosexual, U.S.-based values and interests. In this article we provide a brief background for the re-establishment of this course, offer a literature review defining the normative landscape of LIS, and discuss the positive aspects and pitfalls of injecting this course into the curriculum as a ""diversity"" intervention. Finally, we offer recommendations for how to further make visible and shift the hegemonic landscape in LIS toward an inclusivity that actively deals with how race, gender, class, and sexuality deeply informs our profession.

The Image and Role of the Librarian addresses all aspects of professional identity for librarians, including professional roles, cultural images, popular perceptions, and future trends. The book examines historical representations, stereotypes, and popular culture icons and the role each plays in the relationship between librarian and patron. The book also looks at the profound impact the Internet has had on the services librarians provide and how electronic resources have transformed the roles and responsibilities of librarians. From the Editors: ?There seems to be no profession as preoccupied with self-examination as that of librarianship. While some of it may stem from an identity crisis, the refrain heard over and over is startlingly similar to Rodney Dangerfield's 'I don’t get no respect.' This seems to be true of all types of librarians?from public librarians who (often rightly) complain of being treated like servants by the patrons they serve, to the academic librarians who are always trying to establish their 'faculty-ness' to the teaching professors.? Topics addressed in The Image and Role of the Librarian include: public, student, and faculty perceptions of librarians cinematic portrayals of librarians images of librarians in comic books librarians in children's literature male librarian stereotypes ?know-it-all? librarians changing roles for specialty librarians Generation X and the future of librarianship and much more!

""Skewed"" groups contain a large preponderance of one type (the numerical ""dominants"") over another (the rare ""tokens""). A framework is developed for conceptualizing the processes that occur between dominants and tokens. Three perceptual phenomena are associated with tokens: visibility (tokens capture a disproportionate awareness share), polarization (differences between tokens and dominants are exaggerated), and assimilation (tokens' attributes are distorted to fit preexisting generalizations about their social type). Visibility generates performance pressures; polarization leads dominants to heighten their group boundaries; and assimilation leads to the tokens' role entrapment. Illustrations are drawn from a field study in a large industrial corporation. Concepts are extended to tokens of all kinds, and research issues are identified.","1977","2018-06-20 13:44:59","2018-10-26 20:23:49","","965-990","","5","82","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 482868882</p>; <p>ID: 482868882</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is also a new cohort of MLS librarians who have received their degrees through distance rather than residential programs. The new professional groups have been ""raised"" in other environments and bring to the academic library a ""feral"" set of values, outlooks, styles, and expectations.

Chapter One frames the study, which takes a cultural studies approach, and sets out research questions and methodology. Chapter Two looks at the history of librarian stereotypes, examines library literature on stereotypes, and analyses websites that feature representations of librarians. Chapters Three and Four present public librarians' discussions of stereotypes. By looking at librarian stereotypes through a combination of lenses, namely cultural studies, material and visual culture, and ethnography, I expand upon the ways in which librarian stereotypes have typically been examined. Chapter 5 concludes that librarians negotiate daily and in multiple ways with images and stereotypes of librarians that are maintained by society and culture and as well as by the library as institution.","2005","2018-06-20 13:44:59","2018-10-26 16:30:54","","","140-1977","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Degree: M.A.</p>; <p>Degree: M.A.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their responses were compared with U.S. and Canadian government labor-force projections. The results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students' perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it. The results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title ""librarian"" relative to other fields. Unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study, the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian (most did not believe that librarians require a university education). They also underestimated librarians' average starting salary and rated the occupation's social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles. Taken together, the results indicate that young people beginning their university studies hold views about career prospects in the information sector that are consistent with some laborforce analysts' views of occupational winners and losers. The students see status, opportunity, and success to be attainable in fields such as computer engineering and systems analysis. Unfortunately, they view the occupational present and future for librarians in a somewhat dimmer light, a worrisome result in view of labor-force data that suggest reasonably strong salary and employment opportunities for this occupation in both the United States and Canada. The implications of these findings for library and information science (LIS) education are discussed in the context of gender and identity politics.","2001","2018-06-20 13:45:00","2018-06-20 13:45:00","","289-307","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project focused on the hypotheses that the traditional negative image of librarians is prevalent among school-age children and also, that this image is more prevalent among boys than among girls. The study involved surveying two suburban fourth grade populations in public schools west of Cleveland. A monitored questionnaire was administered by the researcher to one fourth-grade class in each of two school districts. The original research instrument was designed to measure positive and negative factors related to librarian image. Descriptive statistics were employed and results were displayed in a graphic format. Findings refuted both hypotheses. The traditional negative image of librarians was not prevalent among the school-aged children in this study, nor was it prevalent among either the male or female population. Overall, 76.9% of the total sample population rated librarians positively in total image, as did 81.5% of the female respondents and 70.6% of male respondents.

This article provides an extensive discussion about the idea of ""profession."" The author discusses how librarianship stacks up against the established professions and explores whether librarianship is considered as a profession. The author argues that librarianship is not a profession in any sense of the word. Librarians undertake comparatively short graduate training in their discipline. There are no board exams to pass, no strict code of ethics to respect or fear. Almost all librarians work for institutions, rather than individual clients, and are paid by the hour or week, not the task; they are also paid at a much less impressive rate. The comparative social position of librarians as compared to physicians, attorneys, and other professions need only be mentioned in order to make that point. Unless the education and organization offered to library students is to further increase the divide between instruction and practice, between librarians and the irrelevant ""experts"" who teach so many of their required courses, real efforts need to be made to approach professionalism.

Cross-eyed over technology? From the bottom of a pile of paper and discs, books, e-books, and scattered thumb drives comes a cry of hope: Make way for the librarians! They want to help. They're not selling a thing. And librarians know best how to beat a path through the googolplex sources of information available to us, writes Marilyn Johnson, whose previous book, The Dead Beat, breathed merry life into the obituary-writing profession. This Book Is Overdue! is a romp through the ranks of information professionals and a revelation for readers burned out on the clichÉs and stereotyping of librarians. Blunt and obscenely funny bloggers spill their stories in these pages, as do a tattooed, hard-partying children's librarian; a fresh-scrubbed Catholic couple who teach missionaries to use computers; a blue-haired radical who uses her smartphone to help guide street protestors; a plethora of voluptuous avatars and cybrarians; the quiet, law-abiding librarians gagged by the FBI; and a boxing archivist. These are just a few of the visionaries Johnson captures here, pragmatic idealists who fuse the tools of the digital age with their love for the written word and the enduring values of free speech, open access, and scout-badge-quality assistance to anyone in need. Those who predicted the death of libraries forgot to consider that in the automated maze of contemporary life, none of us—neither the experts nor the hopelessly baffled—can get along without human help. And not just any help—we need librarians, who won't charge us by the question or roll their eyes, no matter what we ask. Who are they? What do they know? And how quickly can they save us from being buried by the digital age? 0","2010","2018-06-20 13:45:01","2018-10-26 20:23:46","","","288","","","","","","","","","","Harper","","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Hardcover</p>; <p>id: 1; Binding: Hardcover</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They need (1) basic abilities–literacy and numeracy; (2) organizational qualities, including vision, a questioning approach, perspective, problem-solving and analytical skills (which are essential), communication and social skills, political and economic skills, a sense of service and an ability to accept uncertainty; (3) ""professional"" knowledge relevant to librarianship; and (4) practical library skills. ""Professional"" knowledge can be fairly easily learnt, and skills can and must be acquired in practice. Literacy and numeracy, which are more basic, should be acquired at school, but may need to be further developed. Organizational qualities cannot be taught; they need cultivation in a good environment. Full-time one-off education, for which ""professional"" pretensions requiring a qualification are largely responsible, is unsuited to developing any of these requirements; continuous learning and development are necessary. A broader course in Communication Studies could provide a background for various jobs as well as librarianship. Meanwhile, library education could be improved by several measures, mostly involving greater integration with practice. Library practitioners must also change their attitudes and practices. [To mark the 25th Anniversary edition of ""Education for Information"", editors re-visited articles published in the inaugural issue ""to look again at them through the telescopic lens of a quarter century and to ponder how much has changed and how much has remained constant in educational issues relating to information studies.""

Design/methodology/approach: The study investigates the desired qualities and behaviours required for public library leaders by interviewing 30 senior librarians from Ireland, the UK and the east coast of the USA in order to develop an understanding of the perceptions of current leaders in the field of public librarianship. A review of the relevant literature was used to design an interview guide which was used to conduct structured in-depth face-to-face interviews. Findings: The findings illustrate that there is no universal or common behaviour, even within national boundaries, for effective public library leadership. Two-thirds of the interviewees, however, prioritised attention to the implementation of vision–desired goals–as the most essential element of library leadership. Practical implications: Demonstrates a lack of focus in the leadership problem in librarianship and the need for work to be devoted to the development of leaders. Shows that there is also an absence of success in planning. Originality/value: The current study is the most in-depth study to date on this topic, drawing on face-to-face interviews with 30 public library leaders. Prior to this study, no in-depth face-to-face study on the topic of leadership in librarianship has been researched and published outside of North America. As this study was undertaken in three national jurisdictions–Ireland, the UK, and the USA–it is also the first interview-based transnational study on the topic.

Particular attention is paid to the normal life cycle stages through which all generations pass, and the implications for forecasting how the Millennials' relationship with the world of work will evolve. A second key issue is the extremely large differences in economic opportunity that exist among the members of each generation, and which have increased for more recent generations, particularly those with lower levels of education. Other key issues include the rise in international competition for jobs, and the rising cost of a college education. These factors together imply that simple stereotypes about Millennials taking a privileged view of the world of work may be simplistic at best, and likely are significantly off target.","2010-06","2018-06-20 13:45:02","2018-06-20 13:45:02","","257-264","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; SI: SI; UT: WOS:000277642400007</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Workforce Issues in Library and Information Science 1 (WILIS 1) is a comprehensive study of the career patterns of graduates of LIS programs in North Carolina since 1964. This article examines data from 1,903 working LIS graduate respondents. The results of this study suggests that the LIS workforce is predominantly female, underrepresented in terms of race/ethnic minorities, and consists of slightly older workers than the workforce overall. Comparisons of earnings reveal a substantial wage gap between the male and females in the sample (men earn more). We also find significant race, sex, and gender differences in factors that motivated respondents to enter an LIS program and qualities of jobs that respondents find desirable. Based on these findings, we suggest the following strategies to increasing diversity: (1) focus efforts on recruiting race/ ethnic minorities to the LIS profession; (2) structure LIS jobs to accommodate the needs of women workers; and (3) plan for and accommodate the large segment of older and retiring workers.","2009","2018-06-20 13:45:03","2018-10-26 16:29:49","","192-214","","2","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>PD: Bibliography; Table</p>; <p>PD: Bibliography; Table</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These sectors are of distinct interest given their growing use of `second wave' technologies which aim at `re-engineering' traditional work flows. The article examines the gendered dimensions of such change, focusing particularly on the potential of new technologies to reshape task divisions, and job content, which have long been structured along specific gender and occupational lines. Case studies are used to examine how women's work is being transformed in `traditional' areas, such as secretarial work, as well as `nontraditional' areas in para-legal work and insurance sales. The findings show that there has been a blurring of task divisions between clerical/non-clerical and female/male work, with women experiencing diverse consequences depending on their occupational location. The article illustrates the complexity of current processes of technological change and the importance of tracing out interconnections between different forms of white-collar labour.","1996","2018-06-20 13:45:03","2018-10-26 20:23:45","","227-250","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 439336145</p>; <p>ID: 439336145</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UGPYB8B9","book","2008","Greenberg, Eric; Weber, Karl","Generation we: How Millennial youth are taking over America and changing our world forever","","0-9820931-0-1","","","","In the last three years, the Millennial Generation has emerged as a powerful political and social force. Currently including 95 million young people born between 1978 and 2000, the Millennials are the largest generation in history. They are also the first post-ideological, post-political, and post-partisan generation, and they are spearheading a period of sweeping change in America and around the world. Generation We explores the emerging power of the Millennial Generation, shows how they (and their supporters from other generations) are poised to change our nation and our world for the better, and lays out a powerful plan for progressive change that today s youth is ready to implement. Generation We presents for the first time the results of a major research study into the characteristics of the Millennial Generation, including an in-depth survey of 2,000 individuals and a series of twelve geographically- and demographically-diverse focus groups, all sponsored by author Eric Greenberg and conducted by Gerstein | Agne Strategic Communications, one of the most respected research organizations in the United States. It s the essential guide to the values, dreams, and enormous potential of the Millennials, and could serve as a spark to help kindle the coming youth movement that will restore the damaged American dream. The young members of Generation We are inheriting a world rife with war, environmental degradation, dysfunctional health and educational systems, dangerous dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil, creeping totalitarianism, diminished civil rights, and a fragile economy. Generation We believes that we must innovate our way out of this complex set of problems, discovering and implementing solutions that will work on a global scale and we need to do it soon. Generation We suggests an agenda by which today s youth can help lead an American renaissance. As Greenberg and Weber show, the best way to launch the Millennial revolution is with Project FREE, a massive scientific and industrial program to move America beyond fossil fuels by inventing the next generation of non-carbon based energy a program that will save the environment, end our dependence on foreign oil, create millions of jobs, and jump-start a massive economic boom. Project FREE could be one of humankind s greatest achievements and a proud legacy for the Millennial generation. Generation We also answers the question, What can I do to help turn this vision of a better America into reality? It offers a list of specific steps citizens of any age can take to help promote the progressive ideals and program outlined in the book. Generation We is the book that can inspire a generation to achieve new heights of greatness, allowing Americans to take back control of our lives, our communities, our country, and our future. NEW! Generation We has won the Montaigne Medal for most thought provoking book. 0","2008","2018-06-20 13:45:04","2018-06-20 13:45:04","","","256","","","","","","","","","","Pachatusan","Emeryville, CA","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Paperback DesignPool</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why Millennial collegians will bring a new youth revolution to America's campuses. Why names like ""Generation Y"" and ""Echo Boom"" just don't work for today's kids. Having looked at oceans of data, taken their own polls, and talked to hundreds of kids, parents, and teachers, Howe and Strauss explain how Millennials are turning out to be so dramatically different from Xers and boomers and how, in time, they will become the next great generation. 0","2000","2018-06-20 13:45:04","2018-06-20 13:45:04","","","432","","","","","","","","","","Vintage","","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Paperback R.J.

Ss were 2 groups of 200 librarians each, one unionized and the other nonunionized. Ss completed a 17-item job attribute questionnaire divided into 3 categories: (1) bread-and-butter items (e.g., benefits, salary, job security), (2) professional growth, and (3) work environment. Results indicate no significant differences in the work values of professionals in unionized vs nonunionized libraries. However, differences in work-related values were found when just the union group was studied. Data analysis indicates that registered union members and those most committed to their union placed a higher degree of importance on professional growth issues than did their counterparts.

Among the problems seen are that library schools have become hosts to information science and information studies faculty and curricula. These disciplines are, at best, peripheral to professional library work and, at worst, inimical to it. There is a growing gender divide in Library and Information Science (LIS) schools between ""information science""-oriented male teachers and library course-oriented female teachers. Many of the topics regarded as central to a library education by would-be employers are no longer central to, or even required by, today's LIS curricula. Modern communications technology has led many library educators to concentrate on that technology and dismiss anything about libraries that is not amenable to a technological solution. The gap between what is taught in many LIS schools and what is being practiced in libraries is wide and widening. This paper calls for a national core curriculum that would apply to all schools in a country.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores training, leadership and work-life balance in relation to Millennial librarians. Findings – Certain defining characteristics of the Millennial generation need to be recognized and discussed by library administration and librarians of all generations. Practical implications – Surveying the literature related to Millennial librarians' possible implications can assist in creating increased awareness of this group.

P.","Men at work: using dress to communicate identities","Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management","","","","","Purpose: – The purpose of this paper is to investigate young professional men's perceptions and use of dress in relationship to their work identities. Design/methodology/approach: – Data were collected from 49 young men using a snowball sampling technique. Responses were analyzed using techniques outlined by Van Manen. Findings: – Salience of work identity was not connected to participants’ perceptions and use of dress. However, feeling complete in one's work identity was connected. Participants who perceived themselves as incomplete in their work identities used and planned to purchase items symbolic of their professions. Participants also expected to achieve specific outcomes as a result of their dress. Research limitations/implications: – Research findings support tenets of symbolic self-completion theory. Practical implications: – Men's apparel retailers could promote their apparel as a symbol of qualities young men are interested in expressing and as a means to achieve desired work-related outcomes. Originality/value: – The majority of research on relationships between dress and identity have focused on women. The paper illustrates that, as men are demonstrating renewed interest in their appearance, research that examines how men relate to and use dress in a workplace context has potential to contribute to extant literature and provide practical implications for merchandising apparel.","2011","2018-06-20 13:45:05","2018-06-20 13:45:05","","412-427","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","No Linguistic Content","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 4777964299</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were collected from 508 pupils in total. Both boys and girls perceived the majority of the jobs as being gender-segregated. Girls perceived jobs as being more gender-segregated than did males, but boys stereotyped jobs more than did girls. Both males and females preferred jobs that they saw as stereotypically gender-appropriate and dominated by their own sex. However, for females, this association between job preference and perceived stereotyping/segregation decreased with age, while for males, it remained constant across the age groups. Females claimed more knowledge about jobs they preferred, but for males there was no association between job preference and job knowledge. Results are discussed in the context of UK policies to challenge occupational gender segregation.","2006","2018-06-20 13:45:06","2018-10-26 20:19:26","","67-93","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some older librarians find it hard enough to believe that NextGens are their peers; they simply shut down when faced with the thought that one might be their manager. The author interviewed a number of new managers on the greatest challenges and surprises of their positions. Those in their twenties and thirties invariably described challenges such as: being the youngest person on staff, and feeling that their older colleagues discounted their opinions and ideas. While generational generalizations can be dangerous, people do tend to share a certain commonality of background and experience with their age cohorts that can lead to gaps in communication and outlook between generations. This article offers practical solutions and suggestions to new NextGen managers for bridging the generation gaps in experience, and communication and effective team building. Some of the management techniques suggested include: (1) Going in with the assumption that you will need to convince them of the benefits of any changes and having ammunition ready to support them; (2) Demonstrating willingness to connect with staff and commiting to your library by pitching in on the front lines, even for just a short time each week. Bring your NextGen energy and enthusiasm to all of the work you do, and show that you are a librarian as well as a manager; and (3) Considering everyone's feedback, regardless of their ""professional"" status or official position in the hierarchy. Gordon continues, by challenging managers that when faced with staff who seem ageist and burnt out, it can be tempting just to dismiss them all as dead wood, and reminding managers them that it is their responsibility and challenge to reinfuse their people with their own enthusiasm for this profession.","2004","2018-06-20 13:45:06","2018-06-20 13:45:06","","42","","15","129","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Accession Number: EJ706369; Acquisition Information: Library Journal, 360 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10010.

They quickly began constructing virtual information landscapes, including policies, services, and collections that not only shaped but also defined the realms of possibility within such terrain. In their roles as both terra-formers and cartographers of these spaces, libraries generally modeled the virtual terrains as electronic counterparts of physical libraries. In recent years, gaps have materialized in the virtual terrain, meaning the landscapes they constructed do not provide certain services, resources, or possibilities expected by emerging user populations like the millennial generation. These rifts often represent fundamental disconnects between the values of today's library users and the historical, core values of libraries that shaped the first generation of online information landscapes. In this article, the authors classify those disconnects into three categories–technology, policy, and unexploited opportunities–and discuss ways academic libraries can create next-generation landscapes to address these gaps. If academic libraries want to retain and expand their usefulness for online users in the next decade of the Web, these core disconnects must be addressed today.

Mass media images of society reflect and reinforce the stereotypes and realities of gender tracking, separating males from females beginning in childhood and extending through adult life. There is evidence of different types of usage and different attitudes toward computers between males and females–males tend to focus on the tool itself, and females tend to focus on the utility of the tool. The media capitalizes on the difference in the relationship between people and computers based on gender, further widening the gap by concentrating on or exaggerating stereotypical roles. Women are not well represented in the new generation of high technology occupations, and gender differences with their social consequences are likely to persist in computer-mediated networks. Males and females belong to separate ""natural"" communities–communities determined by birth–however, it is important to work together to find common ground between the male and female communities, and address the issue of gender from within a societal context, rather than from a male versus female approach. Even though the majority of computer network users are males, females must be encouraged to learn skills and be provided with opportunities to have equal access to information, and be portrayed in productive roles using technology. People can influence educational applications of the Web by designing instructional environments that attend to the needs of the female population as well as those of male. (Contains 41 references.)

This research is based on RainmakerThinking Inc.'s ongoing workplace interviews with hundreds of Generation Yers and managers. Like their Gen X siblings, the most talented members of Generation Yers are independent, entrepreneurial thinkers who relish responsibility, demand immediate feedback, and expect a sense of accomplishment hourly. They thrive on challenging work and creative expression, love freedom and flexibility, and hate micromanagement. Guided by managers who are willing to confront their challenges and meet their expectations, they have the potential to become the highest performers in history. They have 14 expectations of managers that can create the type of professional relationships they want to build. Generation Y is just beginning to gain pull in the workplace as full-time workers. Ongoing research is needed to see how our initial conceptions of them as high school and university students plays out as they mature in their professional lives.

The incorporation of epistemology can provide LIS students with more sophisticated sense of how knowledge and information are generated, but can be intimidating to students and instructors alike. Epistemology can be more smoothly incorporated into the LIS classroom using essential questions – overarching, debatable questions that provide context and consequences in learning specific concepts. Brown (2012) recommends essential questions, along with focused conversations, as components of inquiry-based learning in LIS. This article builds on Brown's approach by focusing specifically on how essential questions can be effectively used to teach relevant epistemological concepts that inform gender-related ethical dilemmas students will encounter in professional practice.

In this context, the boundaries between computer scientists and information scientists are exercised in terms of research and vocational activities. The object of the computer scientist is hardware and software, which constitute the necessary background of the total information cycle, whereas the information scientist focuses on efficient ways of information organization, representation and management.

The serials department is always in a constant state of change, but often the personnel within the department either remains the same or decreases in number due to downsizing. As many department heads know, daily duties can change dramatically from year to year as we are asked to do more with less while embracing new technology and standards. This leads us to the question, what is the best method of teaching personnel how to use the upgraded and new software? How do you prepare your staff if the library purchases a new ILS (integrated library system) or they have to learn a new standard such as RDA (Resource Description and Access) that will affect cataloging? How do you get everyone to understand the new ERM (electronic resource management) system or an upgraded version of the library-integrated system with a new interface? In our workforce today, we are dealing with as many as four different generations, including the Silent Generation, Baby Boome Generation X and the Millennials. In addition to generational differences, we have to consider there are also learning differences such as auditory, visual, tactile, and kinesthetic learners.

Two matched samples of Millennials graduating in 2006 (n = 787) and 2009 (n = 825) filled out a questionnaire regarding their psychological contract expectations, career strategy, and optimism about the labor market in completely different socioeconomic contexts. Recession is related to lower levels of optimism. During times of recession, Millennials lower their expectations regarding the work-life balance and social atmosphere. However, their expectations regarding job content, training, career development, and financial rewards remain high, suggesting that these expectations are largely embedded within the generation. Moreover, Millennials' expectations are significantly influenced by individual variables, careerism, and optimism. This study suggests that managers need to focus their limited resources during times of recession on meeting Millennials' high expectations regarding their development and careers. Because violating these high expectations can have detrimental effects on a number of outcomes, organizations are encouraged to discover creative and inexpensive ways to provide Millennials with meaningful work, plenty of learning opportunities and career development. By comparing two matched samples of Millennials in two different situations, this study was able to disentangle generational, contextual, and individual influences on Millennials' psychological contract expectations.","2010-06","2018-06-20 13:45:12","2018-06-20 13:45:12","","293-302","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; SI: SI; UT: WOS:000277642400010</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the largest birth cohorts or generations in history (Baby Boomer) is beginning to retire while their predecessor (Builder) is almost completely out of the workforce. Gen X is hitting stride and on the cusp of inheriting the proverbial organizational mantle. The three aforementioned age cohorts have learned to play in the organizational sandbox together. However, a new age cohort (Millennial, a.k.a. Gen Y), equal or greater in size to the Baby Boomer cohort started entering the playground approximately ten years ago and they are kicking up sand. The etymology of the Millennial story began with a discussion ""about"" Millennials. The conversation quickly moved to strategies for recruiting them. Talk then shifted to on-boarding and managing Millennials. I desire to broaden the dialogue by inviting a discussion with Millennials about how they are experiencing work life. As is the case with any transition, there is great potential for conflict and angst. The purpose of this qualitative study is to identify the challenges Millennials experience while trying to integrate into organizations and the skills that will help them make a successful transition into the workforce.

"99IMEFP5","thesis","2009","Downing, Karen E.","The relationship between social identity and role performance among academic librarians","","","","","","This study explores the relationship between the salience of race/ethnicity, gender, and age identities and the work roles of academic librarians. The ways in which academic librarians perceive their roles in helping others to develop strategic information skills is understudied. This qualitative study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing how social identity(ies) influence the work performance of academic librarians. Though there is a plethora of literature on the individual and institutional impacts of the discipline-based faculty, there is very little about diverse campus librarians, whose roles and contributions to the academic enterprise are central to the mission of creating and disseminating new knowledge. The study analyzes the ways in which diverse librarians draw on their perspectives, experiences, cultural and professional knowledge, and skills to provide robust services and collections for their campus communities. I use the lens of Social Identity Theory (SID), to frame the study. SID examines the ways in which experiences and self-categorization influence actions and perspective. Using Jackson and Holvino's (1997) model of target and agent identities, the study corroborated findings that “target” identities are usually more salient to work practices than “agent” identities. In this study, target identities included those librarians in their 20s-30s, and 60s and older; those who are female; and those whose race/ethnicity is African American, Asian American, and Hispanic. This study identified various micro practices of 24 male and female African American, Asian American, Hispanic, and White librarians of all ages. Micro practices included role modeling professional behaviors for students, acting from a social justice orientation, practicing empathy, and using cultural knowledge and expertise, among many others. Roles such as collection building, reference work, teaching, outreach and liaison work were all impacted by the salience of the librarians' race/ethnicity, age, and gender. By documenting these daily micro practices, the study highlights some of the ways in which librarian diversity is important in creating representative collections throughout the disciplines, more robust library user relationships, and a broader information literacy curriculum.","2009","2018-06-20 13:45:15","2018-10-26 20:22:25","","","259-1189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Degree: Ph.D.</p>; <p>Degree: Ph.D.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But whether young librarians are hip or dowdy doesn't matter. What matters is what they think about the future of the library, particularly at academic institutions. Libraries are facing a series of immense challenges: the explosion of information, a rapidly changing technological environment, shrinking budgets, pitched battles over copyright, a new world of information literacy, and continuing deficiencies in old-fashioned literacy. On top of it all, academic libraries face a crisis of graying leadership. Young librarians, hip or not, will eventually be the people dealing with these issues. This month ""The Chronicle"" contacted eight librarians under 40 and asked them a series of questions about the future of their profession.

Kim","Rethinking information work: A career guide for librarians and other information professionals","","1-59158-180-X","","","www.amazon.com","Create the rewarding, engaging, and resilient information career you dreamed of in grad school with this practical yet inspiring step-by-step guide. Today, information work offers you an unprecedented number of career options. Whether you are a student working towards a career in librarianship, a mid-careerist considering the next professional step, or a seasoned information professional looking for new directions; if you're looking for work in the field, this guide can help you sort through the options. Leading you through a process of planning the information career of your choice, it shows you how to determine what type of work would be most fulfilling to you, explores what types of work are available to those with an LIS-based skill set, and helps you create an action plan for accomplishing your career goals and reaching your professional potential. The author discusses the entire spectrum of information work, revealing a wealth of possibilities you may have never considered. These range from work within traditional, facilities-based librarianship, working in library-related but not necessarily library-based jobs, and working in non-library related positions that utilize the traditional skill sets of the LIS degree, such as research, information organization, training and development, business development, non-profit work, and so on. Designed as a text, this book can also be used as a self-directed guide. The author takes readers step-by-step through a fascinating process of career exploration and action. Taking into account the inevitable shifting priorities that occur throughout one's career, she emphasizes tools for lifelong career resiliency, rather than a rigid commitment to a single career goal. Thus, this is a book you will turn to again and again throughout your career. With numerous tables, worksheets, lists, and extensive bibliographies of recommended resources for further study, both print and on the web, you have everything you need to begin this exciting journey. 0","2006","2018-06-20 13:45:15","2018-06-20 13:45:15","","","236","","","","","","","","","","Libraries Unlimited","","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Paperback</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past, most research on this topic has concentrated on explanations of women's segregation into low paid and low status occupations, or investigations of women who have crossed gender boundaries into men's jobs, and the potential impact on them and the occupations. In contrast, this article reports on a small-scale, qualitative study of ten men who have crossed into what are generally defined as 'women's jobs'. In doing so, one of the impacts on them has been that they have experienced challenges to their masculine identity from various sources and in a variety of ways. The men's reactions to these challenges, and their strategies for developing and accommodating their masculinity in light of these challenges, are illuminating. They either attempted to maintain a traditional masculinity by distancing themselves from female colleagues, and/or partially (re)constructed a different masculinity by identifying with their non-traditional occupations. This they did as often as they deemed necessary as a response to different forms of challenge to their gender identities from both men and women. Finally, the article argues that these responses work to maintain the men as the dominant gender, even in these traditionally defined 'women's jobs'.","2002","2018-06-20 13:45:15","2018-10-26 20:21:59","","204-226","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>CP: Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002; PN: 0968-6673</p>; <p>CP: Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002; PN: 0968-6673</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ZT8QFEII","thesis","1989","Cravey, Pamela Jean Bristow","THE OCCUPATIONAL ROLE IDENTITY AND OCCUPATIONAL ROLE IMAGE OF FEMALE LIBRARIANS IN FOUR TRADITIONAL SUBSPECIALTIES OF LIBRARIANSHIP (PUBLIC, ACADEMIC, SCHOOL, SPECIAL)","","","","","","This project was a modern descriptive view of professionally-committed librarians. It examined the occupational role identity and the occupational role image of female librarians in each of four traditional librarian subspecialties. These subspecialties were academic, public, school, and special librarianship. Occupational role identity was assessed by a national survey of 826 librarians representing equally the four subspecialties. Intraprofessional heterogeneity among these subspecialties was predicted to occur on social background, orientation to the occupational role, and sex-role variables. The illusion of heterogeneity may be created by the situation-specificity of the subspecialties and a general autonomy. Low magnitude differences occurred. Reasons for the overall homogeneity included the associational sample, the identification of the librarian counter-role as ""service receiver"" rather than a specific patron type, and the idea that only one occupational identity for the librarian may exist. The Occupational Outlook Handbook identified three ways of categorizing librarians–by function (user or technical services), by type of library in which employed, and by the economic relationship to the host institution (instructional or business). Multiple discriminant function analysis on selected key variables yielded a fourth categorization of librarian–by the relationship to the profession. Three relationships were examined: Conventional, Contributing, and Contemporary Librarian. Freidson's zones of autonomy and Johnson's continuum of control were used to analyze these librarian categories. Generally, the librarians were satisfied with their careers (except for the pay) and had excellent occupational self images. However, the occupational image of the librarian presented from within the occupation was shallow. Occupational role image was assessed by a content analysis of 8600 product/service advertisements in four related library publications from 1967-1986. Only 101 librarians were portrayed; fifty percent were engaged in computer searching. The professional associations whose role it is, in part, to disseminate the occupational culture and to buffer the occupation from outside forces, were criticized for not enhancing the approved typifications of librarians in their publications and for not bringing the occupational role image portrayed in the advertisements into alignment with the occupational role identity of the practitioners.","1989","2018-06-20 13:45:16","2018-10-26 20:21:58","","","303-3742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Degree: PH.D.</p>; <p>Degree: PH.D.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extending the research on values and person-organization fit using Q methodology, academic librarians completed Q sorts for their most important work values and the most characteristic values of the organization. Individual analysis suggested four factors for individual values: relational, empowered, professional, and competent. Organizational analysis revealed four organizational factors: hierarchy, autonomous, relational, and professional. Job satisfaction, affective and continuous commitment, and intent to leave were measured through a survey instrument. Analysis indicated that individual factors did not produce significant effects on satisfaction, commitment, or intent to leave, while organizational factors did have a significant effect on satisfaction, commitment, and intent to leave. Using libraries that represented the organizational factors, individual and organizational areas of agreement and lack of agreement were examined to determine the person-organization fit of the librarians and to determine effects on satisfaction, commitment, and intent to leave in these representative libraries. Greatest alignment of values occurred in the relational libraries, while the least alignment of values occurred in the hierarchy.

Using data from the NLSY and a finely detailed measure of the gender composition of jobs, I investigate gender differences in wages and in wage growth. I show how they differ between,female-dominated, male-dominated, and balanced jobs. Predictions from Kanters theory of tokenism and the Williams and Acker theory of gendered organizations are tested. Findings indicate that men are advantaged, net of controls, in both pay levels and wage growth in all jobs, regardless of gender composition. Contrary to predictions generated from Kanters tokenism theory, men do not suffer when the, v arc tokens, in terms of pay. Not only arc predictions from Kanter's theory untrue for male tokens, they, also do not hold for female tokens when it comes to wages. Rather, consistent with the Williams and Acker theory of gendered organizations, men arc no more-and no less-advantaged when women are tokens; in terms of earnings, men arc uniformly advantaged in male-dominated, female-dominated, and balanced jobs. Analyses of promotions data indicate that men are also not additionally advantaged whether they are the numerically dominant or minority gender, in fact, male advantage in promotions is the smallest when men are tokens.","2002-05","2018-06-20 13:45:16","2018-06-20 13:45:16","","258-277","","2","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; NR: 30; TC: 48; J9: SOC PROBL; PG: 20; GA: 569DY; UT: WOS:000176586400007</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Probably when attempts to simplify complex concepts become oversimplification. A case in point may be the use of the term ""millennials"". The designations ""millennials"" and ""millennial generation"" are frequently used, allegedly to paint a nuanced portrait of today's college-going population. It seems that wherever one turns–newspapers, journals, or professional meetings–there are opportunities to read or hear about the best ways to teach or reach millennial students. When first introduced, the idea of the millennial generation of students struck a chord with many educators, probably due to its novelty and accessibility. It seems, however, that as the concept has gotten greater and greater exposure in educational circles, it has become less and less useful as a framework for developing strategies that lead to effective learning. Thinking of the college students of this era solely as millennials over-simplifies who the students are and how teachers should best work with them. This kind of thinking perpetuates stereotypes about who attends college and who does not. Although contextualizing the characteristics and experiences of students may be a helpful way to think about them as a group, the more broadly these generalizations are applied, the less accurate they tend to be. This is why the author thinks that the term millennials has only limited usefulness in the educational arena. Thus, the author offers four suggestions to help combat simplistic thinking about students and how to best enhance their learning: (1) meet students' needs by first getting to know them personally; (2) get to know all students by embracing student diversity; (3) keep the focus on education; and (4) practice critical thinking.","2008","2018-06-20 13:45:17","2018-06-20 13:45:17","","30-32","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>LV: Higher Education</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A popular and influential theory describing this relationship is technological determinism. An examination of the history of the computer's graphical user interface reveals that the original inventors of this technology were influenced by theorists associated with the determinist perspective. However, when creating their actual interfaces, early designers Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay utilized methods that support a social constructionist view of technology development. Moreover, as new social interfaces emerge that incorporate software agents into the process of computer interaction, these new designs continue to support a constructionist approach. This article will describe the relationship between theories of technological determinism and the development of graphical user interfaces to argue that a social constructionist approach bridges the gap between theory and invention.

"LNHB9GG3","thesis","1990","Coffey, Monica Anne","THE EVOLUTION OF LIBRARIANSHIP INTO A PROFESSION (DEWEY, AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION)","","","","","","From the viewpoint of librarians, the year 1876 marks a turning point for librarianship in the United States and the advent of a modern professional movement within the field. Despite the expansion of public libraries during the mid-nineteenth century, librarians had no professional organization to facilitate communication among each other and no means of formal education to support intellectual growth in the field. Library pioneer Melvil Dewey defined his own model of professionalism during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Dewey's efforts led the way for two events that promoted professionalization of librarianship. These were the founding of the American Library Association (ALA) in 1876 by Dewey and his colleagues and the opening of the School of Library Economy at Columbia College, New York, in 1887. The findings of this study concluded that the ALA and the School of Library Economy have elements that define a profession. These consist of altruism, an ethical code of behavior, skills linked to intellectual theory, autonomy and a sense of calling to the field. These characteristics carry over to future generations of librarians and define how they view their profession. Further, the advent of formal education and a national organization heightened awareness of issues throughout library history. Those most notable include technological innovations, the role of women in the profession and the relationship between the librarian and the patron. The path of progress for librarianship began a century ago and librarians continue to respond to future challenges and opportunities in much the same manner as did those of the late nineteenth century.","1990","2018-06-20 13:45:19","2018-10-26 20:21:25","","","171-2554","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Degree: PH.D.</p>; <p>Degree: PH.D.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It offers an easy-to-read but provocative account of the development of social theory, covering a range of key figures and classic schools of thought. The authors bridge the gap between philosophy and social theory, locating the theoretical views of individuals such as Michel Foucault, Anthony Giddens and Jürgen Habermas within wider historical traditions. The revised edition includes new material on French pragmatist sociology and cultural sociology, and on contemporary social thinkers such as Zygmunt Bauman, Ulrich Beck, Manuel Castells, Randall Collins, Michael Mann, Saskia Sassen and Theda Skocpol. The authors conclude with a bold, new pragmatist agenda for social theory and the social sciences. Written in a lively style, and avoiding jargon, Social Theory in the Twentieth Century and Beyond is aimed at students who wish to gain an understanding of the main debates and dilemmas driving social theory. Like its predecessor, it will be a standard introduction to modern social theory for students in sociology, politics and anthropology. 0","2010","2018-06-20 13:45:19","2018-06-20 13:45:19","","","248","","","","","","","","","","Polity","","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 1; Binding: Hardcover</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to explore representations of LIS in LIS itself and to research the representation practices of LIS in the social and cultural environment. Design/methodology/approach After identifying some main features of professional discourse on the LIS image, the empirical part of the research particularly explored two questions: how LIS is constituted and how it is embedded in broader social practices. More than 300 articles were collected from the Slovenian daily newspaper with the largest circulation. The sample was analyzed quantitatively and two-fold qualitatively. Findings The results of quantitative analysis outline the formation of LIS's community nature. The results of qualitative analysis mostly show the signifying practices in differentiating between the ""old"" and the ""modern"" and representing practices in creating ""zealous"" librarians and ""suspicious"" users. The results also point to librarians as ""organic intellectuals"". Research limitations/implications The study is exploratory and at this point the thesis on ""organic intellectuals"" cannot be confirmed; in addition to the limits in the analysis methods, the theoretical background needs to be further explored. The findings cannot be generalized due to social and cultural differences. Practical implications The methodology can be applied to other research subjects. The results may be helpful for library managers and library public relations work. Originality/value There are only a few studies of such theoretical and methodological design that have researched the role of the LIS in society. The paper also analyzes the ""image problem"" in the daily newspapers.","2011","2018-06-20 13:45:19","2018-10-26 16:28:41","","293-312","","7-8","112","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 741507566</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there will be a distribution after the first exam, and most likely, only 15% of students will achieve a grade of A. The primary instructional style is the lecture and group work may not be part of the course. Students also need to recognize that strategies such as cramming and memorizing are unlikely to produce good results. Students will be expected to do a fair amount of work on their own such as reading texts or preparing study notes. On average, students should be prepared to spend nine to twelve hours per week on each course, in addition to class time. The faculty should recognize that students are entering first year with a high degree of anxiety. They want to do well but may not have the requisite study skills. Hold organized review sessions and direct students to learning skills workshops. If possible, incorporate some group work into the course.

The generation in question, which some call Millennials, but this article will refer to as NextGens, is made up of people born between 1982 and 2002. At 81 million they form the largest population group since the Boomers at 87 million. The expectations and behaviors of this group will have a significant impact on the nature of the services that public and academic libraries need to plan and provide. This article is based on individual research, some of which is unpublished or proprietary. It is also informed by certain recent key studies published by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, OCLC, Ontario Libraries Strategic Directions Council, Digital Library Federation, Council on Library and Information Resources, Outsell, and others. Although NextGens despise and reject labeling and the authors recognize there are exceptions based on individuality and the remaining digital divide, they have identified nine aspects of the behavior of NextGens that they believe differentiate this group from its predecessors. They represent fundamental differences in the use of information, personal interactions, and social values. The nine impact factors identified in this article provide insights into the coming generation: their expectations for using information (format agnostic, nomadic, multitasking); their learning behaviors (experiential, collaborative, integrated); and their beliefs (principled, adaptive, direct). We must prepare this generation for the real issues of the world they will live through, not the one we encountered. We must focus on helping them develop the ability to evaluate sources of information effectively to ensure that they can determine the quality of information upon which they will base life decisions. This next generation will challenge libraries in ways undreamt of today, likely in ways greater than the challenge of the Internet. .","2004","2018-06-20 13:45:20","2018-06-20 13:45:20","","34","","8","129","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Accession Number: EJ703366; Acquisition Information: Library Journal, 360 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10010.

Visual images in the journals American Libraries, Library Journal, and College & Research Libraries News were analyzed. It was found that the gender makeup of the library profession was not portrayed accurately in these publications' visual images. Women were visually underrepresented compared to the numbers working in the library profession, whereas men were visually portrayed more often than their percentage in the library profession would suggest. Discussion of the results is provided.","","2018-06-20 13:45:22","2018-10-26 20:24:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Physical Description: Bibliography</p>; <p>Physical Description: Bibliography</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CG3LHDBF","book","2008","","Taking sides: clashing views in gender","","0-07-351529-9","","","","This debate-style reader is designed to introduce students to controversies in gender studies. The readings, which represent the arguments of leading psychologists and other social commentators, reflect a variety of viewpoints and have been selected for their liveliness and substance and because of their value in a debate framework. Students will be exposed to a rich, exciting, and emotionally and politically charged body of theory, research, and practice. TAKING SIDES: GENDER, containing 20 issues organized into six parts, presents hotly debated issues in contemporary scholarly and public discourse. Students will actively develop critical thinking skills by analyzing opposing viewpoints and reach considered judgments. The issues will challenge students to consider what is sex, what is gender, and when is either relevant, and why. They will discover that what might appear to be binary, biologically based distinction is so much more. An Instructor’s Resource Guide (available online only) accompanies the book. For each issue, the following have been provided: a synopsis of each author’s position on the issue, teaching suggestions, and multiple-choice and essay questions. The teaching hints consist of suggestions for generating class discussion around the themes raised by the clashing essays. 0","2008","2018-06-20 13:45:23","2018-10-26 20:24:35","","","416","","","","","","","","","","McGraw-Hill/Dushkin","Dubuque, IA","English","","","","","","","","<p>id: 5; Binding: Paperback</p>; <p>id: 5; Binding: Paperback</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are trying to integrate the most demanding and most coddled generation in history into a workplace shaped by the driven baby-boom generation. Like them or not, the millennials are the world's future work force. This book provides a rich portrait of a complex and intriguing generation, told through the experiences of the millennials themselves and from the perspectives of their parents, educators, psychologists, recruiters, and corporate managers. Clearly, the millennials represent a new breed of student, worker, and global citizen, and this book explores in depth their most salient attributes. Although they're hard working and achievement oriented, most millennials don't excel at leadership and independent problem solving. They like the freedom and flexibility of a virtual office, but they also want rules and responsibilities to be spelled out explicitly. ""It's all about me"" might be the mantra of this demanding bunch of young people, yet they also tend to be civic minded and philanthropic. The book discusses what companies can expect from their new hires and provides valuable lessons about how some employers are changing tactics to recruit and retain millennials in the Internet age. He also describes the fascinating relationships between the proud, protective parents—so central to the lives of the millennials—and their beloved trophy kids.

Librarians may not be fully engaging with the possibilities of IT because they are only using, rather than creating, information technology. Examining the implications of gender underrepresentation and gendered identities in both fields is a starting point for investigating librarians' relationship with IT. In particular, stereotypes for the female gender and the librarian profession may be an impediment in librarians' involvement in IT. Librarians may self-stereotype themselves out of engaging with IT by identifying strongly with female and librarian stereotypes, which can be considered to be incompatible with IT stereotypes. However, upon closer examination, stereotypes can be shown to be false and those who previously self-stereotyped can adopt more balanced identities, aiding performance. Finding positive role models who do not fit stereotypes may be helpful. Expecting a comprehensive IT education in library school is misguided, but problem-based learning – commonly seen in IT – is one method librarians could adopt. Libraries should prioritize and make allowances for IT skill development and librarians can take advantage of the increasing opportunities for learning about IT.

The development of a model is described; the status and prospects of innovation in the 1980s are considered and selected innovations in bibliographic utilities, online searching, and output performance measures over time are traced; and 54 individual case studies of the adoption and use of innovations at 18 academic, public, and special libraries are analyzed. Finally, 11 hypothesis clusters of special interest in understanding the diffusion process are presented, and their implications for the development of a diffusion network are considered. Appendices include the data collection instruments, a 62-item annotated bibliography and a longer full bibliography, and a summary of each of the case studies.

Contributions in Librarianship and Information Science, Number 86","","ISBN-0-313-28673-6","","","","This book is concerned with potentially dramatic changes in the public library. It views the library's historical pattern of reactionary, evolutionary change as no longer viable, but in need of being replaced by planned, proactive, and innovative change. The central thesis of the book is that the necessary transformation of the public library from an institution designed to serve the needs of an earlier age may best be facilitated through the development of more effective systems for the creation, transfer, and utilization of managerial information and innovation among public librarians. The first chapter provides a broad overview of the twin themes that run throughout the book: organizational change and innovation in general, and the patterns that have traditionally characterized change in public libraries. Chapter 2 identifies several classical models of the innovation diffusion process found in the literature on organizational change and innovation. Major events and trends that shaped the public library field through the early 1960s are examined in chapter 3. Developments during the decade or so between 1966 and 1979 are viewed as creating an environment conducive to a potentially radical change in direction for public libraries. These developments are outlined in chapter four. The events surrounding the development and diffusion of the Public Library Association's (PLA) planning and measurement techniques are treated in detail in chapters 5 through 8. Chapter 9 compares the development, diffusion, and adoption of Public Library Association's innovation with the traditional models previously identified. The pattern of how the process is currently working in the field of public librarianship is used in the final chapter to suggest an improved mechanism for facilitating public library change.

"Y6JW75ZZ","journalArticle","2008","Carter, Timothy L.","Millennial Expectations and Constructivist Methodologies: Their Corresponding Characteristics and Alignment","Action in Teacher Education","","","","","In recent years, much emphasis has been placed on constructivist methodologies and their potential benefit for learners of various ages (Brandt & Perkins, 2000; Brooks, 1990). Although certain aspects of the constructivist paradigm have replaced several aspects of the behaviorist paradigm for a large contingency of stakeholders (particularly, schools of education and national learned societies), this large-scale shift has not been apparent among many key participants in public education. A variety of suspected reasons exist for this lack of transition, including the lack of clarity in defining constructivism (Null, 2004; Woolfolk, 2008), potential difficulties in application (Perkins, 1999), and previous generations' expectations about education (Howe & Strauss, 2000). However, this article suggests that the current Millennial Generation's expectations of learning strongly align with tenets of constructivist methodology and that these constructivist expectations (client demands) should broadly affect the educational practices of university and public school personnel in the near future.","2008","2018-06-20 13:59:11","2018-06-20 13:59:11","","3-10","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ833553</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VNRS95NI","journalArticle","2008","McGlynn, Angela Provitera","Millennials in College: How Do We Motivate Them?","Education Digest: Essential Readings Condensed for Quick Review","","","","","In academia, there is much discussion about ""millennial"" students–those born between 1982 and 2002. Although there is a mix of students in college classes, particularly at community colleges, the influx of millennials is notable in terms of their sheer numbers. This year will see the largest high school graduation class ever–even bigger than the baby boomer high school graduates of the 1960s. There are many who think millennial students are not simply incrementally different from generation that preceded them but are qualitatively different. Many educators feel frustrated that millennials are especially difficult to reach and to motivate. In this article, the author emphasizes that before teachers can begin to motivate millennial students to take their studies seriously and to persist through their college programs to earn a degree, teachers must engage them actively in the learning process. Student-engagement data from the National Survey of Student Engagement for four-year institutions and the Community College Survey of Student Engagement for the community college sector, makes it clear that student engagement is the key to academic motivation, persistence, and degree completion. Here, the author discusses how to get students' attention and get them actively engaged with the course material and with their peers. He suggests that reaching these millennial students in order to engage, motivate, and inspire them needs to be addressed so that there can be an intersection between how they learn and how educators teach.","2008","2018-06-20 13:59:12","2018-06-20 13:59:12","","19-22","","6","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ798989</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HCO students experience the complex nature of organizational communication by immersion in a four-week participatory simulation. Wilensky and Stroup (1999) define participatory simulation as a role-playing situation that utilizes emergent activities in order to help learners concretize abstract content into a personally meaningful understanding. In HCO, the participatory simulation is used to provide students with a role-playing situation that will facilitate a learning environment in which students can experiment and discover how complex dynamic communication systems evolve and how to apply organizational communication concepts to shape that evolution. Since student use of instant messaging and social media sites led the instructor to question if the simulation was losing its authenticity, this article discusses a project designed by the authors to improve the simulation by providing more believable and relevant materials, activities, and communication channels. In order to integrate digital communication technologies that would facilitate student use of these tools for teamwork, the authors designed and developed the following solutions: a mock intranet for the fictitious company, OrgCom Associates which included a discussion board, chat tool, and support materials, and a realistic website for the fictitious client, Knowledge College. This project suggests that the millennials are not able to integrate their supposedly inherent technology adeptness into academic work even when they perceive the digital communication technology as authentic and potentially beneficial.

This paper emphasizes the implementation phase of the planned change process. A review of the literature is provided, leading up a description of the author's research on change in libraries. Using some hints about facilitating conditions from Mayhew (1975), the author identified the following eight conditions that appeared to facilitate the implementation of education technology innovations: (1) dissatisfaction with the status quo; (2) existence of knowledge and skills; (3) availability of resources; (4) availability of time; (5) rewards or incentives exist; (6) participation; (7) commitment; and (8) leadership. Continued searching for further confirmation in the literature has strengthened confidence in these eight conditions. This paper concludes with recommendations for future research in this area.

Specifically, they describe the current generation, the Net Generation, of traditional-age college students who have grown up with computers and the Internet, living in a rapid-response, multimedia, anytime-anywhere networked world that has shaped their worldview, their reaction times, and how they learn. Though these students may be multitaskers who favor graphics over text, communicate with equal ease in person and online, expect instantaneous responses, and who prefer Google to the library, their comfort with technology may not be synonymous with competency. Faculty and administrators, from earlier generations, do not understand their students' IT preferences. This article compares the differences between these generations. When asked what they deem most important in an optimal learning milieu, students place faculty expertise at the top of their list. The authors suggest that university faculty and administrators should not assume that they understand their students simply because they were once students, but need to understand that times, technologies, and students change. Faculty and administrators need to ask: (1) Do we know our students and their preferences, or do we assume we know? (2) How are we adapting programs to students' needs? (3) What balance of physical and virtual will best serve our student population? (4) Are our building and renovation plans based on outdated assumptions? and (5) What is the proper balance between student and faculty perspectives?

"BKEGDKZ7","journalArticle","2007","Wilder, Stanley","The New Library Professional","Chronicle of Higher Education","","","","","This article discusses what the growing generation gap among library employees mean for academic research libraries and for the profession. Viewed collectively, the members of the under-35 cohort are a harbinger of a new kind of academic library professional, one whose traits bear directly on the ability of libraries to thrive amid the continuing revolutions in scholarship, teaching, and learning. The generation gap in research libraries begins with the large proportion of young people who work at jobs that either did not exist for their older colleagues, or were not associated years ago with librarianship. Using the 2005 demographic data from the Association of Research Libraries, which collects information on the professional staffs at its member libraries, the author has isolated the nontraditional types of jobs and found that people in nontraditional positions accounted for 23 percent of the professionals at research libraries in 2005, compared to just 7 percent in 1985. But the most compelling aspect of the nontraditional population is its youth: 39 percent of library professionals under 35 work in such nontraditional jobs, compared with only 21 percent of those 35 and older. Nontraditional professional positions are not only growing in size and influence; they also pay more. Compensation is thus another factor separating younger and older library employees. Finally, most information-technology professionals in libraries are male (71 percent), which is not the case in other types of library positions (28 percent male).","2007","2018-06-20 13:59:14","2018-06-20 13:59:14","","","","25","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ757217</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The umbrella term for these new technologies–Web 2.0–began gaining traction in 2004. Many librarians were quick to embrace the new wave of technology. Early adopting libraries used blogs to initiate contact with their patrons, wikis to collect information, and social networking sites to connect with each other and their communities. Among the extensive discussions revolving around best practices for implementing Web 2.0 tools in public libraries and the multitude of examples of how to reach out to users via these new technologies, there seems to be no discussion about ""how many"" libraries were adopting 2.0 technologies or how those libraries differed from their peers who were not venturing down this path. The author presents a study titled, ""U.S. Public Libraries and the Use of Web Technologies,"" initiated by Colorado State Library's Library Research Service (LRS). The LRS's study aims to determine which libraries were adopting 2.0 technologies, how ""successful"" those libraries were, and whether adoption of these technologies was contributing to that success.

Thirty-nine librarians from United States and Canada participated in the study by answering the questionnaire. The study consisted of two rounds. In the first, participants were asked to grade seventeen statements and answer four open questions posted on a Web site. In the second round, participants were asked to provide an explanation for answers that fell outside of the consensus. The study investigated the panelists' views on the following issues: (a) the changing nature of libraries and of the information profession, (b) user-generated content at the library, (c) the library's role as a learning center, and (d) adoption of Web 2.0 technologies in libraries. Participants' answers also revealed issues with the marketing of library services. Findings revealed a big difference between what participants viewed as desirable and what they thought as probable for most issues.

It is highly unlikely that one would find a person working in a library, or in any other organization for that matter, whose professional and personal life had not been affected by the internet. Based on statistical evidence, it is easy to understand why the web has been characterized as the ""new normal"" in the average person's way of life; those who don't go online constitute an ever-shrinking minority. It is within such an environment that people have seen the emergence of a new era of web-enabled applications that are built around user-generated or user-manipulated content and commonly referred to as Web 2.0. Web 2.0 refers to a perceived second-generation of web-based services–such as social networking sites, wikis, communication tools, and folksonomies–that emphasize online collaboration and sharing among users. Library experts have used simpler terms to describe the Web 2.0 phenomenon: (1) the read/write web, where users are both consumers and producers of online content; (2) an interactive two-way web; and (3) a place where everyday folks with internet access can create and edit material. In this article, the author discusses the Web 2.0 revolution, the analogous derivatives it has spawned such as Library 2.0, Library User 2.0, and Librarian 2.0, and how Web 2.0 technologies may be integrated into library services.","2009","2018-06-20 13:59:14","2018-06-20 13:59:14","","16-21","","10","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ861519</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Change agents should have an awareness and understanding of the process by which new ideas are adopted, and they must be organized, decisive, motivated, and effective. The change agent can be categorized according to two major types of variables: the change agent's perceptions of the situation and the change agent's identity, which includes knowledge, skills and abilities, attitudes, and personality characteristics. There are four generic types of change agent–a catalyst, solution giver, process helper, or resource linker. By becoming library change agents, youth services specialists can effectively plan and implement innovative library services and programs for children and young adults.","1997","2018-06-20 13:59:14","2018-06-20 13:59:14","","264-72","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive groups are said to come about as a result of managers' cognitive segmentation of their environment for the purpose of minimizing uncertainty and dealing with bounded rationality. As the group identity grows, the groups form, with the influence of macro and micro variables, into significant substructures that are greater than the sum of their parts. Groups are described as having a strong identity when they are adequately accepted and supervised by members in a manner that direct their individual behavior. These strategic groups with strong identities can have an impact on the performance of the firm. The conditions allowing the creation of strong identities and their progressive shifts are described.","1997","2018-06-20 13:59:52","2018-06-20 13:59:52","","","p165(22)","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>RP: Not in File; undefined</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper takes the form of a literature review. The notion of, what can be termed, ""identity-based views of the corporation"" is introduced. Each of the ten identity based perspectives that inform the above are underpinned by a critically important question which is believed to be of considerable saliency to marketing scholars and policy advisors alike. As a precursor to an exposition of these ten perspectives, the paper discusses five principal schools of thought relating to identity and identification (the quindrivium) which can be characterised as: corporate identity (the identity of the organisation); communicated corporate identification (identification from the organisation); stakeholder corporate identification (an individual, or stakeholder group's, identification with the organisation); stakeholder cultural identification (an individual, or stakeholder group's, identification to a corporate culture); and envisioned identities and identifications (this is a broad category and relates to how an organisation, or group, envisions how another corporation or group characterises their identity or mode of identification.) Each of the ten identity-based views of the corporation outlined here is underpinned by a question of critical importance which aims to be of assistance to senior executives in comprehending and managing identity-related concerns of the corporation. The introduction of notions relating to identity based views of the corporation/corporation brands represents, perhaps, a natural denouement for the ""schools of thought"" approach which has long-characterised the British School of scholarship vis-à-vis corporate identity scholarship since the early 1990s.

Using qualitative, interview, and records data, we describe how members from eight ""top-20"" business schools responded to the 1992 Business Week survey rankings of U.S. business schools. Our analysis suggests that the rankings posed a two-pronged threat to many members' perceptions of their schools' identities by (1) calling into question their perceptions of highly valued, core identity attributes of their schools, and (2) challenging their beliefs about their schools' standing relative to other schools. In response, members made sense of these threats and affirmed positive perceptions of their school's identity by emphasizing and focusing on their school's membership in selective organizational categories that highlighted favorable identity dimensions and interorganizational comparisons not recognized by the rankings. Data suggest that members' use of these categorization tactics depended on the level of identity dissonance they felt following the rankings. We integrate these findings with insights from social identity, self-affirmation, and impression management theories to develop a new framework of organizational identity management.","1996","2018-06-20 13:59:52","2018-06-20 13:59:52","","476","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facet analysis provides an established scientific methodology for the conceptual organization of a subject field, and the structuring of an associated classification or controlled vocabulary. This paper explains how that methodology was applied to the humanities in the FATKS project, where the objective was to explore the potential of facet analytical theory for creating a controlled vocabulary for the humanities, and to establish the requirements of a faceted classification appropriate to an online environment. A detailed faceted vocabulary was developed for two areas of the humanities within a broader facet framework for the whole of knowledge. Research issues included how to create a data model which made the faceted structure explicit and machine-readable and provided for its further development and use. In order to support easy facet combination in indexing, and facet searching and browsing on the interface, faceted classification requires a formalized data structure and an appropriate tool for its management. The conceptual framework of a faceted system proper can be applied satisfactorily to humanities, and fully integrated within a vocabulary management system. The procedures described in this paper are concerned only with the structuring of the classification, and do not extend to indexing, retrieval and application issues. Many stakeholders in the domain of resource discovery consider developing their own classification system and supporting tools. The methods described in this paper may clarify the process of building a faceted classification and may provide some useful ideas with respect to the vocabulary maintenance tool.","","2018-06-20 14:00:28","2018-06-20 14:00:28","","","@prism.endingPage|virtual.citation.endpage@","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>TY: GEN</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data for this study was assembled by searching the Library, Information Science, and Technology Abstracts database for articles that have used the term `knowledge organization' or `information organization' in their titles, abstracts, or descriptors. Taken as a whole, these preliminary results suggest that the content of the KO literature has shifted since the advent of the web. Although classic KO principles remain prominent throughout both eras, the presence of new content areas, such as metadata, denotes a shift in KO trends. In the pre-web era, the literature was related in large part to indexing and abstracting. In contrast, cataloging and classification issues dominate the landscape in the post-web era. The findings from this paper will be of particular use to those interested in learning about upcoming trends in the KO literature.","2008-10-01","2018-06-20 14:00:29","2018-06-20 14:00:29","","651-666","","5","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first section of the report defines the general characteristics of KOSs, with emphasis on their connection to a particular view of the world. The historic origins and uses of KOSs, in libraries and in other information management environments, are described, and various types of KOSs are discussed. The second section provides examples of how KOSs can be used to enhance digital libraries in a variety of disciplines, and describes how a KOS can be used to link a digital resource to related material. The third section discusses how KOSs can be used to provide disparate communities with access to digital library resources by using a KOS to provide alternate subject access, to add a new mode of access to the digital library, to provide multilingual access, or to support free-text searching. The report concludes with a discussion of issues to consider when using KOSs with digital libraries. It provides a framework for the design, planning, implementation, and maintenance of KOSs in digital libraries. (Contains 36 references.)

While the initial motivation for the project was pragmatic in nature, theoretical issues relating to people's cognitive categories for information are examined as well. Literature indicates that the manner in which people categorize information reflects their understanding of that information. People categorize information based on their own unique experiences, all of which contribute to their overall understanding of the world. The shared knowledge of a culture that is contained in a library, however, needs to be classified in a manner understandable by the entire community. It is of interest, therefore, to the library and information science community to examine the manner in which a library user moves from his or her personally typified categories for information toward the library's categories for information in order to successfully interact with the library. This case study focuses on a time when many people first experience formal instruction relating the library's method of organization–it examines the cognitive categories for library information of participants in kindergarten through grade 4 for differences that might indicate a move from a more personal understanding toward a more sociocultural understanding of information in the library. In addition to examination of an important theoretical issue, this research may lend insight into the development of systems more supportive of interactions with information in a culturally organized corpus.","2004","2018-06-20 14:00:30","2018-06-20 14:00:30","","299-336","","3","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ875897</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Popperian ontology then has to be extended to admit the concept of information and its relation to subjective and objective know ledge. The spaces of Popper's three worlds are then con sidered.

The findings are synthesized in a conceptual framework for understanding the types and causes of disruptive behavior, which fall into the categories of inattention, acting-out, and threatening/harmful/violent. Factors that may contribute to disruptive behavior are the presence of a disability; history of an impoverished social background and/or of exposure to personal violence; personal stressors such as child care and job demands; and, in the learning environment, inadequate instruction, disconnection with the instructor and/or other learners, and ineffective intervention by the instructor. A set of guidelines is offered for preventing and managing disruptive behavior. It is further recommended that research be directed toward identifying interventions that are effective with specific adult education populations and how to train adult educators to deal with disruptive behavior.

Online assessment strategies include having a wide variety of clearly explained assignments on a regular basis and providing meaningful and timely feedback to students regarding the quality of their work. Effective assessment techniques include projects, portfolios, self-assessments, peer evaluations, and weekly assignments with immediate feedback.

Auctioning over the internet gives a variety of opportunities that are not offered for consumers offline. However, on the other hand, it also provides good conditions for opportunistic behaviors because of the high degree of information asymmetry. To prevent online auction fraud, preventative controls verifying the identities of auction users can be imposed. However, these measures can adversely affect the potential user-base of online markets. In this paper, we examine the ex-post detection of online fraud. Among examples of serious online fraud prevalent in auctions, we investigate the factors necessary to detect “online credit card phantom transactions,” which are fake transactions for illegal loan sharking through the collusion of the seller (creditor) and buyer (debtor). In this paper, we develop a plausible detection methodology for online fraud. In addition, employing a data collection agent, we demonstrate cost-efficient ways of data collection. Auctioneers, e-business firms with fraud-related problems, and regulatory agencies can all take advantage of this methodology. Academically, we believe that our research is a new addition to the body of empirical studies on online auction fraud.","2010","2018-06-20 14:02:19","2018-06-20 14:02:19","","2991-2999","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper outlines the basic positions of the two schools, and then considers the extent to which it is possible to reconcile them. A possible framework for such a task by Riding ( 1997 ) is discussed and areas of commonality are highlighted. Neither school is free from criticism, and a summary of the criticisms of the constructs and the data collection instruments is provided in each case. Finally, research into the impact of the two schools on student learning is considered. Overall it is concluded that investigation of students' Learning Styles or Approaches to Learning are probably of more benefit to the teacher than to the individual student.","2005","2018-06-20 14:02:20","2018-06-20 14:02:20","","235-249","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>ID: EJ719325</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although context cannot be ignored anymore, educators often struggle to explain how people learn in and with various contexts. Situated cognition and culturalhistorical activity theory (CHAT) hold promise for understanding how adult learners are cultural and historical agents embedded within and constituted by socially structured relationships and tool-mediated activity. This promise, however, is not yet realized as the politicized nature of learning in practice that is foundational to both situated cognition and CHAT remains overlooked in adult learning literature. To move toward fulfilling the promise, this literature review emphasizes the neglected dimensions of recursivity and power within situated cognition and CHAT frameworks.

This study examines American students' responses to a university admission policy for African students that produced an open, closed or tokenism context, when attention was focused on their own or the disadvantaged group. An open context always received higher approval ratings than a completely closed context. However, when attention was focused on the ingroup, tokenism received higher approval ratings than the closed context, whereas, when attention was focused on the outgroup, tokenism was viewed as negatively as the closed context. These findings are discussed in terms of tokenism's inherent ambiguity and its influence on advantaged group members' support for change.","2010-09","2018-06-20 14:08:09","2018-06-20 14:08:09","","559-569","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; UT: WOS:000281948700002</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CFR8TKYC","book","1993","","Doing ""women's work"": Men in nontraditional occupations","","","","","","(From the cover) [This book] represents the first effort to summarize our state of knowledge about the effects of men in women's professions—on the men and their views of masculinity, on the occupations, and on the women with whom they work. Do men get preferential treatment in these positions? Higher salaries? Are they treated the same as their female coworkers? Through a series of statistical and demographic analyses as well as qualitative case studies of men in such professions as teaching, secretarial work, caregiving, and stripping, the authors offer an insightful glimpse of the roles of these men in bolstering or undermining the gendered assumptions of occupational sex segregation in the workplace. [This book] will be invaluable reading for students, researchers, and professionals interested in gender studies, work and occupations, human resources, sociology, management, human services, family studies, psychology, and education.

Can the profession stand another article in the general press that trumpets the amazing new discovery that librarians can be young, trendy, stylish? The level of our colleagues' responsibility, or their abilities cannot be defined by clothes, piercings, hair color, tattoos, and makeup ... or lack thereof. In defining the image of nextgen librarians, there is a need to move beyond the extremes and think about where that image as a library professional originates. The need to break away from stereotype walks a fine line. Young librarians should realize that when they define themselves against the sensibly shod, bunned librarians of their elementary school days, they are in danger of falling into a stereotype themselves. Librarians must build an image based on who they really are. Individual images come down to common sense. Those who tilt more toward the individuality side of the scale will fit well in positions (Yale comes to mind) where their distinct image is appropriate and appreciated. Those who tilt more toward comfort might gravitate to a more informal working environment. Those in a Fortune 500 corporate environment might need to emulate other company cubicle dwellers in order to be taken seriously. This ever expanding profession has a style and a place for every personality, style, and image. When you find your perfect fit, you can settle into your library home.","2004","2018-06-20 14:08:12","2018-06-20 14:08:12","","52","","","","","","","","","","","Library Journal","","","","","","","","","","<p>Accession Number: EJ701707; Acquisition Information: Library Journal, 360 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10010.

This concept evolved out of the frustrated hopes of 1950s corporate ""systems men"" (represented by the Systems and Procedures Association) to establish themselves as powerful ""generalist"" staff experts in administrative techniques. By redefining the computer as a managerial ""information system,"" rather than a simple technical extension of punch-card ""data processing,"" the systems men sought to establish jurisdiction over corporate computing and to replace accountants as the primary agents of managerial control. The apparently unlimited power of the computer supported a new conception of information, defined as the exclusive domain of the systems men (assisted by operations research specialists and computer technicians). While MIS proved impossible to construct during the 1960s, both its dream of all-encompassing automated information systems and the resulting association of information with the computer endured into the twenty-first century.","2001","2018-06-20 14:08:16","2018-06-20 14:08:16","","61","","1, Computers and Communications Networks","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were collected from a diverse sample of U.S. employees (N = 115,044) obtained from 18 years of repeated administrations of the Kenexa WorkTrendsTM employee opinion survey. The data were analyzed using a hierarchical age-period-cohort regression model which has been recommended for the analysis of generational effects using repeated cross-sectional data. Findings: In general, work attitudes differed across generations, although effect sizes were relatively small and depended on the work attitude. Compared to Boomers and Gen Xers, Millennials reported higher levels of overall company and job satisfaction, satisfaction with job security, recognition, and career development and advancement, but reported similar levels of satisfaction with pay and benefits and the work itself, and turnover intentions. Implications: While generational differences do exist, whether they warrant special programs for Millennials is debatable. The cost of tailoring an intervention to each generation should be weighed against the potential benefits of considering generational differences. Originality/Value: To our knowledge, no study has empirically examined differences in work attitudes across five generations while controlling for the confounding effects of age and time period.

The status-consistent group contained 128 women and 118 men. The status-inconsistent group was composed of 89 women and 102 men. Our results indicated that workers in occupations in which the majority of workers are the same gender had significantly higher levels of work satisfaction than those in status-inconsistent occupations. However, subsequent analyses revealed that men and women employed in occupations in which the majority of workers are men had higher levels of work satisfaction than those employed in women-dominated occupations. These findings held when controlling for other work-satisfaction factors, such as individual earnings, hours worked per week, and length of time employed. We suggest that the effect of status consistency on work satisfaction is mediated by the cultural value attached to the occupations men dominate.","1991","2018-06-20 14:08:25","2018-06-20 14:08:25","","206","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A test of Kanter's theory of tokenism","Journal of Criminal Justice","","","10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.04.036","","Kanter's tokenism theory argues that once tokens reach a tipping point of 15 percent representation in the work place, they begin to experience fewer work place problems. This study tested this assertion using a survey of eighty-seven officers in a midwestern municipal police agency, where female officers constituted over 17 percent of the total sworn patrol officers. The three dimensions of tokenism were examined quantitatively to ascertain differences between male and female officers. On two of the dimensions, there were no differences between male and female officers, but the third dimension showed that female officers still perceived their work place differently from male officers. Only partial support of Kanter's theory was found. It was evident that even in this department, however, females still felt like they stood out and were underestimated by their peers. The findings also suggested that tokenism is more complex than a ""numbers game,"" and that quantitative examinations alone might not fully explain the myriad aspects of tokenism.

Specifically, it examines the degree to which discrimination disadvantages men in hiring and promotion decisions, the work place culture, and in interactions with clients. In-depth interviews were conducted with 99 men and women in these professions in four major U.S. cities. The interview data suggest that men do not face discrimination in these occupations; however, they do encounter prejudice from individuals outside their professions. In contrast to the experience of women who enter male-dominated professions, men generally encounter structural advantages in these occupations which tend to enhance their careers. Because men face different barriers to integrating nontraditional occupations than women face, the need for different remedies to dismantle segregation in predominantly female jobs is emphasized.","1992","2018-06-20 14:08:27","2018-06-20 14:08:27","","267","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim has been to assess how much real transformation these applications can bring about, in terms of creating genuine user benefit and also changing everyday library practice. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a summary of some of the legal and ethical issues associated with web 2.0 applications in libraries, associated with a brief retrospective view of some relevant literature. Findings - Although web 2.0 innovations have had a massive impact on the larger World Wide Web, the practical impact on library service delivery has been limited to date. What probably can be termed transformational in the effect of web 2.0 developments on library and information work is their effect on some underlying principles of professional practice. Research limitations/implications - The legal and ethical challenges of incorporating web 2.0 platforms into mainstream institutional service delivery need to be subject to further research, so that the risks associated with these innovations are better understood at the strategic and policy-making level. Practical implications - This paper makes some recommendations about new principles of library and information practice which will help practitioners make better sense of these innovations in their overall information environment. Social implications - The paper puts in context some of the more problematic social impacts of web 2.0 innovations, without denying the undeniable positive contribution of social networking to the sphere of human interactivity. Originality/value - This paper raises some cautionary points about web 2.0 applications without adopting a precautionary approach of total prohibition. However, none of the suggestions or analysis in this piece should be considered to constitute legal advice. If such advice is required, the reader should consult appropriate legal professionals.","2010","2018-06-20 14:08:32","2018-06-20 14:08:32","","489","","7","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing the presence of librarians of color may help to improve diversity within LIS. The central questions explored here can be divided into two parts: (1) Why do ethnic minorities choose librarianship as a profession? (2) What would motivate members of minority groups to join a profession in which they cannot see themselves? The research was conducted through semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 33 ethnic minority students from one of four ethnic minority groups. Eleven themes emerged from the data: Libraries, Librarians, Library Work Experience, LIS Graduate Program, Career Plans and Goals, Education and Family, Support, Mentors, Ethnicity and Community, Acculturation, and Views of Diversity. The findings seem to support many assumptions regarding ethnic minority recruitment in LIS. The most noteworthy findings were those that centered on identity, acculturation and diversity because they dealt issues that are not often considered or discussed by many in the profession outside of ethnic minority organizations.","2006","2018-06-20 14:08:32","2018-06-20 14:08:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 666432954</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article addresses the following question: does an increased number of women corporate boards result in a build up of critical mass that substantially contributes to firm innovation? The aim is to test if 'at least three women' could constitute the desired critical mass by identifying different minorities of women directors (one woman, two women and at least three women). Tests are conducted on a sample of 317 Norwegian firms. The results suggest that attaining critical mass - going from one or two women (a few tokens) to at least three women (consistent minority) - makes it possible to enhance the level of firm innovation. Moreover, the results show that the relationship between the critical mass of women directors and the level of firm innovation is mediated by board strategic tasks. Implications for both theory and practice, and future research directions are discussed.","2011-08","2018-06-20 14:08:32","2018-06-20 14:08:32","","299-317","","2","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; UT: WOS:000293746600008</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While students are enrolling in collegiate STEM degree programs, it is not occurring at a rate that meets the workforce demand. In addition to the concern that there is not a sufficient amount of collegiate STEM majors, there is a concern over too few females enrolling and persisting in collegiate STEM degree programs. This mixed methods sequential exploratory research study considered the factors that influence and motivate undergraduate female students to enroll and persist in collegiate STEM degree programs. The research study was conducted in four phases. The first phase of the study focused on exploring the factors that influenced first-year female freshmen to enroll in a collegiate STEM degree program. Qualitative data were collected from undergraduate females enrolled in a STEM degree program. The second phase, instrument development, involved developing a survey instrument that consisted of 15 questions. The survey included a combination of (a) the Motivated Student Learning Questionnaire, (b) the questions developed from the findings from the qualitative phase, and (c) a demographic section. In the third phase of the research study, quantitative data collection, the survey instrument was administered to a sample of undergraduate female STEM majors. The fourth phase integrated the findings from the qualitative and quantitative phases. Five factors were considered as being significant to undergraduate female STEM majors when choosing a collegiate degree program: (a) helping others in their career, (b) having access to pre-collegiate STEM exposure, (c) obtaining information about STEM career pathways, (d) establishing relationships with influential stakeholders, and (e) developing confidence in math and science. The findings from this study illustrate the role of K-12 STEM educators, pre-collegiate STEM outreach programs, and STEM education policymakers in influencing and motivating female students to enroll and persist in collegiate STEM degree programs.

It also affects the relationships among cluster members on the management team. Although effective collaboration does not guarantee success among STEM disciplines, its absence usually assures problems. More specifically, collaboration has the obvious roles of identifying talents coming together for a common purpose of combining knowledge and sharing responsibility, creativity, and experience of others. Facilitating collaboration across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields in program development is critical to providing a strong educational foundation to all learners in STEM education. This synergistic effort among educators and other professionals across the STEM fields will enable effective knowledge sharing in program development.

Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature. Purpose This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers. Scope/Method This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research. Conclusions Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.

The study also describes the graduate students’ perceptions of the physical and psychological components that enhance or detract from their ability to find, appraise, and use information and how they feel during the various stages of an information search. This snapshot investigation illustrates that physical science graduate students form an information-literate microcosm despite the lack of formal library instruction. The students offer a small number of reasons why they may be inhibited from locating an information source and report experiencing little anxiety as they search for information. They also describe their ideal information-seeking environment as being within the comfort of their home or the convenience of the library. Further, they place some emphasis, but not total reliance, on the capability to connect to the Internet quickly. Relevance, quality, and speed are the cornerstones of a successful search quest. Recommendations for outreach to graduate students who are not native speakers of English are made. Also, suggestions are proposed for library instruction that is specifically designed for, and attracts a greater number of, physical science graduate students.","1999","2018-06-20 14:09:41","2019-08-01 14:13:32","","426-438","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, there are large modal tendencies with age that have import for policy making, service planning, and social institutions.

How can the educational gerontology curriculum encourage not just the accumulation of facts and information but a deeper wisdom, a knowing, about what it means to grow older? This article suggests that our content, our methods, and our values have limitations. The standard educational gerontology curriculum provides the primary colors or core for understanding but needs to be augmented with a fuller palette. This palette should be both more comprehensive and less prescriptive, being adaptable to minority, sub-group, and other cultural contexts.

This is a discourse perpetuated within the academy, the workplace, and society at large. But what are the effects of this discourse? Are students aware faculty harbor the belief students can't write? Is student writing or confidence in their writing influenced by the negative tone of the discourse? This dissertation attempts to demonstrate that a discourse disparaging student writing exists among faculty, across disciplines, but particularly within the engineering disciplines, as well as to identify the reach of that discourse through the deployment of two attitudinal surveys--one for students, across disciplines, at Michigan Technological University and one for faculty, across disciplines at universities and colleges both within the United States and internationally. This project seeks to contribute to a more accurate and productive discourse about engineering students, and more broadly, all students, as writers--one that focuses on competencies rather than incompetence, one that encourages faculty to find new ways to characterize students as writers, and encourages faculty to recognize the limits of the utility of practitioner lore.","2010","2018-06-20 14:09:42","2018-06-20 14:09:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Michigan Technological University","United States -- Michigan","","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: dissertations&theses; Object type: Dissertation; Object type: Thesis; Copyright: Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2010; DOCID: 2260843681; PCID: 54819311; PMID: 66569; DocISBN: 9781124437934; DissertationNum: 3439123; PublisherXID: 3439123</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses data from IPEDS and the American Community Survey to estimate the possible misrepresentation of reported bachelor degree completions by racial and ethnic group and citizenship status in the biological and biomedical sciences and engineering. We found that nearly all of the racial and ethnic groups in IPEDS may be significantly misreported because of the reporting standards for U.S. citizenship.

Prior research focused on access for women into advanced high school mathematics and science courses. Parity has been achieved in academic prerequisites for STEM studies in higher education, yet the number of women majoring in STEM has remained static. Recent research has focused on the socio-cultural obstacles that women face, including a lower self-confidence in their abilities, bias and gender stereotypes. A survey was undertaken to examine the self-confidence, opinions and backgrounds of female students persisting as STEM majors at two technological institutions. The results confirmed strong academic preparation, but also revealed a high level of self-confidence in their abilities and future outlook, especially in students attracted to STEM at an early age. The results of this study can inform program initiatives to attract more young girls to STEM majors.

Many analyses have revealed a level playing field, with men and women faring equally, whereas other analyses have suggested numerous areas in which the playing field is not level. The only widely-agreed-upon conclusion is that women are underrepresented in college majors, graduate school programs, and the professoriate in those fields that are the most mathematically intensive, such as geoscience, engineering, economics, mathematics/computer science, and the physical sciences. In other scientific fields (psychology, life science, social science), women are found in much higher percentages.In this monograph, we undertake extensive life-course analyses comparing the trajectories of women and men in math-intensive fields with those of their counterparts in non-math-intensive fields in which women are close to parity with or even exceed the number of men. We begin by examining early-childhood differences in spatial processing and follow this through quantitative performance in middle childhood and adolescence, including high school coursework. We then focus on the transition of the sexes from high school to college major, then to graduate school, and, finally, to careers in academic science.The results of our myriad analyses reveal that early sex differences in spatial and mathematical reasoning need not stem from biological bases, that the gap between average female and male math ability is narrowing (suggesting strong environmental influences), and that sex differences in math ability at the right tail show variation over time and across nationalities, ethnicities, and other factors, indicating that the ratio of males to females at the right tail can and does change. We find that gender differences in attitudes toward and expectations about math careers and ability (controlling for actual ability) are evident by kindergarten and increase thereafter, leading to lower female propensities to major in math-intensive subjects in college but higher female propensities to major in non-math-intensive sciences, with overall science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors at 50% female for more than a decade. Post-college, although men with majors in math-intensive subjects have historically chosen and completed PhDs in these fields more often than women, the gap has recently narrowed by two thirds; among non-math-intensive STEM majors, women are more likely than men to go into health and other people-related occupations instead of pursuing PhDs.Importantly, of those who obtain doctorates in math-intensive fields, men and women entering the professoriate have equivalent access to tenure-track academic jobs in science, and they persist and are remunerated at comparable rates—with some caveats that we discuss. The transition from graduate programs to assistant professorships shows more pipeline leakage in the fields in which women are already very prevalent (psychology, life science, social science) than in the math-intensive fields in which they are underrepresented but in which the number of females holding assistant professorships is at least commensurate with (if not greater than) that of males. That is, invitations to interview for tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields—as well as actual employment offers—reveal that female PhD applicants fare at least as well as their male counterparts in math-intensive fields.Along these same lines, our analyses reveal that manuscript reviewing and grant funding are gender neutral: Male and female authors and principal investigators are equally likely to have their manuscripts accepted by journal editors and their grants funded, with only very occasional exceptions. There are no compelling sex differences in hours worked or average citations per publication, but there is an overall male advantage in productivity. We attempt to ...

The primary goal of this paper is to provide some preliminary findings on why there are so few women in the STEM fields. As a secondary goal this paper discusses the way that human information behavior can impact on the research behavior of male and female scientists in STEM and how this influences their use of libraries and research resources. Implications for LIS educators are suggested. LIS educators teaching future LIS practitioners are provided with some ideas to consider in terms of working with women in STEM and considering their information needs.

Specifically, we examined an overall measure of professional outcome expectations, along with participants’ anticipation of the chances that they will “get a good job in their field,” “achieve success in their career,” and “combine a professional career with having a balanced personal life.” Findings indicated that attending a coeducational STEM L/L program and discussing academic and career issues with peers were positively related with three of the outcome measures. Additional findings spoke to the importance of self-efficacy and interactions with diverse peers in the development of professional outcome expectations among women in STEM. Implications are presented for higher education institutions’ efforts to support coeducational and women-only STEM-related L/L programs, peer and faculty interactions, and diverse peer interactions.

The relationship between IL and lifelong learning is associated with improvements and cohesion in academics. Librarians and instructors seem to have documented a common and supporting purpose when it comes to educating science and technology students. A purposefully inculcated foundation of IL is the basis for any set of lifelong-learning skills. It is impossible to have the ultimate professional skill set without instruction and practice in research, discernment, and the articulation of ideas. These types of critical-thinking skills can be taught and learned through guidance and practice in the classroom. Insights and direction from practiced academic professionals make developing IL skills a much easier process than if one had to develop these skills alone and at point-of-need on the job. Corporate leaders are aware of the value of employees with IL skills. Without this skill many workers might be ill-equipped to deal with the information overload that is common in the science and engineering professions. The contribution of IL to lifelong learning and the career of engineers and scientists can be easily seen in the value added to one's skill set and the resulting demand from employers. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) has defined information literacy in general, and this has been further refined to encompass a set of standards for science and engineering disciplines. These standards are comparable to those demanded by ABET, Inc. (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). When practitioners of these standards are able to successfully impart standard and skills to students, then these students will find an added value in their careers, especially as they navigate the information overload of the digital age. Instructors are advised to keep up with the review literature maintained by ACRL.","2012","2018-06-20 14:12:37","2018-06-20 14:12:37","","21-24","","","","","","","Lifelong Learning for Engineers and Scientists in the Information Age","","","","Elsevier","London","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385214-4.00004-0","","","","","","Smith, Ashok N.

The evaluation of bibliographies (citations), as an assessment tool, falls within the category of “performance assessments.” It is the systematic assessment of the products of students' performance. All curricula provide with many opportunities for performance assessments, such as bibliographies, essays, presentations, research journals, and term papers, among others. A simple checklist can be used to assess the citations, which indicates that the criteria have been met. A checklist provides better results if a rating scale is added. Rubrics provide a way of measuring the degree to which a particular skill has been mastered, used or incorporated into a bigger process. The research log as an assessment tool is suited for longer research projects and in particular for design projects in engineering. Worksheets are a simple and useful tool for assessment of student skills and the effectiveness of library instruction. Worksheets are usually used by K-12 teachers, but they can be adapted for use in college library instruction, especially for freshmen and lower division courses. A worksheet is a one or even half-page sheet that gives students step-by-step instructions on how to do research. It is frequently utilized during or immediately after a lecture and demonstration to reinforce basic principles. A broad overview of the different assessment tools in information literacy assessment is provided. The chapter highlights four assessment methods—citation analysis, research logs, worksheets, and portfolios—within the context of an engineering curriculum.","2012","2018-06-20 14:12:37","2018-06-20 14:12:37","","49-62","","","","","","","Lifelong Learning for Engineers and Scientists in the Information Age","","","","Elsevier","London","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385214-4.00007-6","","","","","","Smith, Ashok N.

Findings indicate that the majority of students have some understanding of information literacy skills; however, a significant number were not familiar with important concepts such as search techniques, identifying print citations, how to determine bias or quality of sources, and correct citation behaviors when using research or copyrighted works. These data are being used to further develop an information literacy program that focuses on faculty development and targets areas where students lack the necessary skills for academic success and lifelong learning ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of Reference & User Services Quarterly is the property of American Library Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

In Taiwan, few research has investigated the information literacy of biomedical graduate students. This exploratory study examined the information literacy abilities and training of biomedical graduate students in Taiwan. Semi-structured interviews based on the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Science and Engineering/Technology were conducted with 20 molecular biological graduate students. The interview inquired about their information-seeking channels and information literacy education The findings show that the biomedical graduate students developed a workable thesis topic with their advisors. Through various information-seeking channels and retrieval strategies, they obtained and critically evaluated information to address different information needs for their thesis research. Through seminars, annual conferences and papers, the interviewees were informed of current developments in their field. Subsequently, through written or oral communications, they were able to integrate and exchange the information. Most interviewees cared about the social, economic, legal, and ethical issues surrounding the use of information. College courses and labs were the main information literacy education environment for them to learn about research skills and knowledge. The study concludes four areas to address for the information literacy of biomedical graduate students, i.e., using professional information, using the current information, efficiency in assessing the domain information, and utilization of diverse information channels. Currently, the interviewees showed rather low usage of library resources, which is a concern for biomedical educators and libraries.

Our approach-based on the work done in the field of genre analysis and argumentation theory-means that we teach students to read research articles by teaching them which rhetorical moves occur in research articles and how they can identify these. Because research articles are persuasive by their very nature, we focused on the rhetorical moves that play an important role in authors' arguments. We designed a teaching strategy using cognitive apprenticeship as the pedagogical approach. It was implemented in a first-year compulsory course in the life sciences undergraduate program. Comparison of the results of a pretest with those of the posttest showed that students' ability to identify these moves had improved. Moreover, students themselves had also perceived that their ability to read and understand a research article had increased. The students' evaluations demonstrated that they appreciated the pedagogical approach used and experienced the assignments as useful. On the basis of our results, we concluded that students had taken a first step toward becoming expert readers.","2014-06","2018-06-20 14:12:38","2018-06-20 14:12:38","","253-264","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; NR: 60; TC: 0; J9: CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC; PG: 12; GA: AM4GY; UT: WOS:000339812800009</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information professionals need to find out strategies and courses of action undertaken by undergraduate students in order to perhaps improve information literacy skills or user education programmes. This qualitative study uses the diary, emails interaction and in depth face to face interview approach involving 14 final year Computer Science and Information Technology undergraduates whom shared their information search and use process. The objectives of this study are to find out the followings: (a) the decision on deciding research topics by final year students; (b) the sources and channels of information they use and prefer; (c) the utility of libraries and librarians; (d) the use of the Internet; (e) the search strategies adopted; (f) their thoughts on intellectual property and ethical issues. Among the main information sources used were the Internet, books and previous final year project reports. They also seem to rely a lot on their friends and lecturers as their source of information. Very few used journal articles, seminar papers or other sources. An understanding of their information seeking behaviour patterns is the focus of this paper. Informants' thoughts and feeling on the library services and the ethical use of information will be shared.

MacArthur Campus Library (JDM) to share methodologies and ideas with other academic libraries. Recently, there has been an emphasis on and push for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in colleges and universities across the USA as a means for training future work forces and for remaining competitive in global job markets (Land, 2013). FAU in South Florida is a big proponent of STEM and STEAM education (Florida Atlantic University, 2012; Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, 2013). Design/methodology/approach: As many librarians and outreach staff strive to remain relevant to their faculty and students with changing technologies (Drewes and Hoffman, 2010), the FAU JDM outreach staff have developed several novel programs that are geared toward the STEAM initiative. Findings: The Library Outreach Committee at FAU was committed to investigating how they could advance student success through visual arts programming. How can the library help contribute to STEAM education for the students and learning community as a whole? How can the library engage art students? Can the library promote dialogue in arts to the faculty and staff, regardless of their disciplines? This article will describe and discuss the various art outreach programs that the JDM has tested and their outcomes addressing goals toward STEAM education and academic libraries. Originality/value: The objective in sharing the experiences at the JDM is to spark new and successful program ideas at other academic libraries across the country and abroad and create knowledge in this relatively new area.","2015","2018-06-20 14:12:39","2018-06-20 14:12:39","","677-695","","","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, recent studies have found very little improvement in engineering graduates' lifelong learning skills. Research on information literacy, a critical component of lifelong learning, in technical fields is limited. Purpose/Hypothesis This study sought to evaluate the information skills of first-year engineering students. Specifically, it investigated the extent to which students gather information from a variety of sources and from high-quality sources, use gathered information to support an argument, and document information sources. Design/Method This study used content analysis of memos written by teams of engineering students. A random sample of 40 memos, selected from a pool of 263, was coded using InfoSEAD, a structured coding protocol developed for this study. Results Overall, 82% of the sources used were Web resources, of which 12% were of high quality. From the information threads that could be traced to the original source, 68% were relevant and used appropriately. Due to documentation errors in the memos, 28% of the sources cited could not be classified, and 57% of the information threads identified could not be traced to the original source. Conclusions Student teams mostly relied on Web resources, but their documentation skills were weak. When students did successfully document information, it was generally done appropriately.

The objectives of this phase were to: 1) gain an in-depth understanding of how computer science and engineering faculty members currently obtain information and thus influence students, 2) determine changes needed in the collection/services of the library to facilitate this information flow and implement desired change and 3) share this experience so other librarians may question whether their faculty members also feel misunderstood and 4) initiate a dialogue with faculty members to obtain their perspective and insight. Focus Group standardized protocol with a trained facilitator and recorder was employed to gather qualitative data from 47% of the computer science and engineering faculty. The facilitator employed a pre-designed guide to elicit responses about current and desired library collections and services. Nine major information behaviors or issues were identified as needing to be addressed. From this feedback, collection/services changes were implemented to support the positive information behaviors and to overcome barriers to enhancing students' information literacy and life-long learning skills while assuring faculty members that their needs were heard and understood.

CREATE also supports maturation of undergraduates' epistemological beliefs about science. This approach, originally tested with upper-level students, has been adapted in Introduction to Scientific Thinking, a new course for freshmen. Results from this course's initial semesters indicate that freshmen in a one-semester introductory course that uses a narrowly focused set of readings to promote development of analytical skills made significant gains in critical-thinking and experimental design abilities. Students also reported significant gains in their ability to think scientifically and understand primary literature. Their perceptions and understanding of science improved, and multiple aspects of their epistemological beliefs about science gained sophistication. The course has no laboratory component, is relatively inexpensive to run, and could be adapted to any area of scientific study.","2013-03","2018-06-20 14:12:41","2018-06-20 14:12:41","","59-72","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; UT: WOS:000317267600009</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few measures of scientific literacy are available to assess students' proficiency in using scientific literacy skills to solve scenarios in and beyond the undergraduate biology classroom. In this paper, we describe the development, validation, and testing of the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS) in five general education biology classes at three undergraduate institutions. The test measures skills related to major aspects of scientific literacy: recognizing and analyzing the use of methods of inquiry that lead to scientific knowledge and the ability to organize, analyze, and interpret quantitative data and scientific information. Measures of validity included correspondence between items and scientific literacy goals of the National Research Council and Project 2061, findings from a survey of biology faculty, expert biology educator reviews, student interviews, and statistical analyses. Classroom testing contexts varied both in terms of student demographics and pedagogical approaches. We propose that biology instructors can use the TOSLS to evaluate their students' proficiencies in using scientific literacy skills and to document the impacts of curricular reform on students' scientific literacy.","2012-12","2018-06-20 14:12:41","2018-06-20 14:12:41","","364-377","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; NR: 79; TC: 5; J9: CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC; PG: 14; GA: 066IY; UT: WOS:000313215300008</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is tested with a group of Master's level engineering students attending a construction materials' seminar. The IL instruction consists of presenting the basics of information searching in general, the basics of bibliometrics, and searching guidelines of the most important databases in the field of mechanical engineering and material science. After the lecture, the students attend an instructed hands-on information retrieval training session. In order to enable information retrieval from the most important non-English sources, the students attend tailored French or German language education according to their choice. To determine whether information literacy education can be used as a means of improving the technological university undergraduate students' research skills, special attention is paid on the students' ability to describe their research problems and to formulate the research questions in their final papers. Moreover, the scientific value and versatility of the source literature are observed. The research methodology for evaluating the model is based on classical qualitative analysis.

It is therefore crucial that Biotechnology students have the skills to access the relevant information for their studies and critically evaluate the vast volume of information and its sources. By developing information literacy skills, which are part of lifelong learning, Biotechnology graduates are better prepared for their careers. Students also need to understand the issues related to the use of information such as social, political, ethical, and legal implications. This paper will outline the embedding of information literacy skills within the Biotechnology degree at the University of South Australia. Examples of specific activities and their link to assessment will be discussed.

Lecturers, tutors and students share goals, morals and values, attitudes and behaviours from a local and global perspective. Students engage with the subject matter by writing personal journals, communication tutorials, computing skills, drawing skills and teamwork. This approach is an attempt to enrich the curriculum and teaching/learning process by improving student understanding of self and the way others behave and communicate. This understanding will continue to evolve over time and hopefully permeate all personal and professional decision making which ultimately affects quality of life.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the relations between students’ science teaching attitude, logical thinking ability, information literacy self efficacy and academic achievement through internet assisted chemistry education. The study was carried out in the spring term of the 2006-2007 academic years for 10 weeks and 61 prospective science teachers enrolled in the science teacher education program at Marmara University constituted the study groups of the research. For this purpose, the students were randomly split into two groups. Group-1 (N = 30) developed a teaching website for electrochemistry and Group-2 (N = 31) prepared teaching portfolio for the same subject as homework. Data were collected by the Test of Academic Achievement, the Turkish version of the Science Teaching Attitude Scale II (STAS-II) revised by Moore and Foy, logical thinking ability test and information literacy self efficacy scale. Pearson Moments Correlation coefficient was used for the analysis of the data to specify the relations between the students’ science teaching attitude, logical thinking ability, information literacy self efficacy and chemistry achievement. In addition to that, to obtain the most suitable regression equivalent in explaining the students’ chemistry achievement, multiple regression analysis was used. At the end of the study for the first group; it was revealed that the students’ chemistry achievement significantly correlates with their science teaching attitude (r = 0.663; p 0.05). Also, these variables significantly predict the students’ chemistry achievement. The independent variables (science teaching attitude and logical thinking ability) explain about 78.4% of the total variance of the chemistry achievement. On the other hand for the second group, the students’ chemistry achievement significantly correlates with their information literacy self efficacy (r = 0.480; p 0.05) and logical thinking ability (r = 0.293; p > 0.05). Also, information literacy self efficacy significantly predict the students’ chemistry achievement and explains about 20.3% of the total variance of the chemistry achievement.","2009","2018-06-20 14:12:43","2018-06-20 14:12:43","","1526-1532","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, recent research indicates that students largely lack the competencies associated with information literacy and that many colleges and universities are not moving beyond one-shot, course-level library instruction sessions to integrate information literacy into their curricula at the program and institutional levels. One reason for this lack of progress may be that discipline faculty—those who have the most direct contact with students, as well as the most direct oversight of and responsibility for the curriculum—have been largely missing from the conversation. This study aims to fill this gap by surveying and interviewing a nationwide sample of teaching faculty in six disciplines for their perspectives on the importance and relevance of information literacy competencies for their students. The results of this study provide academic librarians a broader insight into faculty understanding of information literacy and will help to advance the discourse of information literacy further into the disciplines.","2012","2018-06-20 14:12:44","2018-06-20 14:12:44","","226-236","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More and more libraries are offering STEAM programs in one form or another, and still more libraries are making booklists on STEAM topics to help connect to the Common Core State Standards being adopted by their local schools. STEAM programming has the ability to allow libraries to engage young customers who may not have been drawn to storytimes, book clubs, or craft programs. These programs are the bread and butter of youth library programs, but they do not represent the full spectrum of what librarians can do with the collections they have. Libraries come in many shapes and sizes with plenty of variations in staffing, funding, and support. As a result, STEAM programs and services will not look the same from one library to the next. Resources should not be a deterrent for libraries looking to add STEAM elements to what they offer children. Any children's staff member can plan and offer programs, and there is a fit for every library. From passive programs to fullblown STEAM events, the options in this article should help get you started.

The initial information literacy abilities are formed in comprehensive school as presently, these educational establishments have the possibility of employing different information technologies. It is probably often related to appropriate computer technologies and the Internet. During the last five years, a number of investigations into the field of natural science education have been carried out. On the other hand, to more accurately identify the situation in different regions of Europe, lack of in-depth expert research can be noticed. Therefore, the latter survey (expert inquiry) is aimed at examining the situation on using ICT in natural science education in Baltic countries. A precondition that the obtained findings will be useful for improving the process of natural science education in terms of ICT applicability and efficient use can be made.

It means that nowadays the question about information culture is becoming more and more important. The process of forming information culture is aimed to train and develop a creative person and his self-development. In the authors' opinion information culture is an extent of knowledge, abilities and skills connected to the search for, processing, storing and creation of information items using new information technologies, realizing the necessity of using information resources; principles and rules of the person's behavior in information and communicative systems; vital aims, estimations and attitude to the world.

A.","Information fluency for undergraduate biology majors: applications of inquiry-based learning in a developmental biology course","CBE life sciences education","","","10.1187/cbe.07-10-0091 [doi]","","Many initiatives for the improvement of undergraduate science education call for inquiry-based learning that emphasizes investigative projects and reading of the primary literature. These approaches give students an understanding of science as a process and help them integrate content presented in courses. At the same time, general initiatives to promote information fluency are being promoted on many college and university campuses. Information fluency refers to discipline-specific processing of information, and it involves integration of gathered information with specific ideas to form logical conclusions. We have implemented the use of inquiry-based learning to enhance and study discipline-specific information fluency skills in an upper-level undergraduate Developmental Biology course. In this study, an information literacy tutorial and a set of linked assignments using primary literature analysis were integrated with two inquiry-based laboratory research projects. Quantitative analysis of student responses suggests that the abilities of students to identify and apply valid sources of information were enhanced. Qualitative assessment revealed a set of patterns by which students gather and apply information. Self-assessment responses indicated that students recognized the impact of the assignments on their abilities to gather and apply information and that they were more confident about these abilities for future biology courses and beyond.","2008","2018-06-20 14:12:46","2018-06-20 14:12:46","","54-63","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMCID: PMC2262132 PMID: 18316808","<p>id: 1; LR: 20130902; JID: 101269039; OID: NLM: PMC2262132; ppublish</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose (Hypothesis) Two hypotheses were tested: during the freshman through senior years, (i) engineering students increase their use of cognitive strategies to process written forms of information; (ii) the ways in which students respond to written information become more interpretive, analytic, and critical. Design/Method Two validated scales were administered to engineering majors in their freshman through senior years. One scale measured use of reading strategies; the other measured attitudes about interpreting and critiquing written information. Additional questions concerning school-related academic and reading activities and were used to interpret the scale scores in the context of the engineering curriculum. Results First-year students had significantly higher analytic skills upon entry into the university, compared to a general university sample. There was a significant increase in the use of reading strategies from freshman through senior years, particularly practical reading strategies. There was also an increase in using written information as a resource, and a decline in critical analysis of written sources. Data about texts that students read linked these patterns to an emphasis in the curriculum on reading textbooks, solving textbook problems, and taking tests. Conclusion These cross-sectional data suggest that engineering curricula are a significant influence in shaping the development of information fluency. A major implication is that engineering students have analytic and intellectual skills that can be developed further through adjustments to curricula.","2011","2018-06-20 14:12:47","2018-06-20 14:12:47","","397-416","","2","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally relegated to a final-year design project, more and more engineering design projects are appearing earlier, even in the first-year of undergraduate education. With the increased frequency of these projects that are problems without a single ‘right’ answer, engineering librarians are finding more opportunities to work with students throughout their educational careers instead of just in a capstone course. To fully take advantage of these opportunities, librarians need to translate their own knowledge of information literacy into the language of engineering educators, and indeed inform the pedagogy of those educators. This paper attempts to create just such a bridge, focusing on the information resources and processes needed by engineers engaged in the design process and bringing together the literature of both the engineering education and library science communities.","2012-03-01","2018-06-20 14:12:47","2018-10-26 20:22:43","","47-52","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also explored the nature of these references, in terms of authorship, Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) information literacy competency standards addressed, and degree of emphasis on information literacy topics. In addition to characterizing information literacy in the science pedagogy literature, the study presents a methodology that can be adopted by future efforts to explore representations of information literacy in the literature of additional academic disciplines. Methods - The 2011 Journal Citation Reports® Science edition was used to identify the 15 journals with the highest impact factor in the ""Education–Scientific Disciplines"" subject category. Initially Web of Science was searched to identify occurrences of ""information literacy"" and related terms in the journals of interest during the 10 year period 2002-2011. This was supplemented by a title scan of the articles to ensure inclusion of relevant items that did not include library-centric terminology. Abstracts and, where necessary, full papers were reviewed to confirm relevance. Only articles were included: editorials, news items, letters, and resource reviews were excluded from the analysis. Articles selected for inclusion were read in their entirety. Professional designations for each author were identified to characterize the authorship of this body of literature. Articles were also classified according to levels developed by O'Connor (2008), to indicate whether information literacy was a ""Major Topic,"" ""Substantive Focus,"" ""Incidental Mention,"" or ""Not Explicitly Named."" Further analysis mapped each article to the ACRL information literacy competency standards (2000), to provide more detailed insight into which standards are most frequently addressed in this body of literature. Results - Articles on information literacy-related topics appear only sporadically in science pedagogy journals, and that frequency varies depending on the specific subject area. Overall, librarians contribute a relatively small proportion of these articles, and are more likely to co- author with teaching faculty/graduate students than to publish alone or with other librarians. The degree of focus on information literacy topics (O'Connor level) varies depending on article authorship, with librarians more likely to treat information literacy as the ""Major Focus"" of their work. Additionally, the articles tend to cluster around ACRL information literacy standards two, three, and especially four, rather than addressing them equally. Conclusions - The presence of some articles on information literacy-related topics in science pedagogy journals suggests that there is a willingness among these journals to publish work in this area. Despite this, relatively few librarians have pursued this publication option, choosing instead to publish articles on information literacy topics within the library and information studies (LIS) literature. As a result, librarians are missing out on the opportunity to share their published work in venues more likely to be seen and valued by subject faculty, and on the chance to familiarize science educators with information literacy topics. Future research should focus on: librarians' rationale when selecting target publications for their information literacy writing; science educator interest in writing and reading about information literacy topics in their pedagogical journals; and the impact of articles about information literacy in these journals on subject faculty perceptions of the topic's importance. The methods used in this research have implications for the study of information literacy in other academic disciplines, and demonstrate that the study of information literacy in the literature of academic disciplines can provide valuable insights into representations and characterizations of information literacy in diverse fields of study. A better understanding of how subject faculty think and write about information literacy in their scholarly literature could have a significant impact on how librarians approach and collaborate with faculty in all fields of study.

Two validated scales measuring self-reported use of reading strategies and beliefs about interpreting and critiquing written information were administered to engineering students at an Indian Institute of Technology in their freshman to senior years. Neither prediction was supported: Indian students reported applying analytic strategies over pragmatic strategies and were more disposed to critically analyze information rather than accept it passively.

Central to this change is recognition that undergraduate education programmes should aim to develop independent learners who become effective lifelong learning practitioners. Successful independent learning as an undergraduate student or as a lifelong learner requires the learner to have well developed information literacy skills. An Online Electronic Information Skills (OEIS) intervention was designed to develop the information literacy skills in a cohort of second year undergraduate radiography students. An evaluation focused on learning outcomes was used to provide evidence of development of information literacy within the undergraduate course. The evaluation clearly demonstrated substantial skill development in students' ability to access scholarly information in their discipline area.

In the case of undergraduate engineering students, this extends to building their information literacy skills, an important component in helping them become lifelong learners; to be curious and independent, and to take greater responsibility for their own learning. The challenge in building information literacy in engineering students is to acquaint the students with the array of library resources available to them and to help them intelligently navigate the systems that contain the information. Too often, information literacy instruction is presented as a set of procedures for locating a hypothetical resource in the library. However, students are not interested in finding some resource randomly chosen as an example; they want to find resources that they perceive as being important and useful. During the 2005-2006 academic year, the engineering librarians at Drexel University took this into consideration and employed a new methodology for information literacy instruction: combining an online tutorial covering basic library skills with face-to-face consultations between student design teams and the engineering librarians. By utilizing varied instruction techniques aimed at different learning styles, with a strong active learning component delivered at the student's point of need - when they have a concrete, perceived information need - information literacy instruction can be improved so that engineering students retain more and develop lifelong learning skills.

The two programs are Engineering Information Sources and Access (EISA), implemented as a Web-based self-learning prototype system; and Information Sources that Every Engineer should Know (ISEEK), which adds an embedded instructional layer and representative queries, and which constitutes the core layer of engineering sources for a beginner engineering student. Of analytical significance, the project: (1) defines indicators of information literacy (IL) for engineering students; (2) tests student IL skills; (3) develops an IL profile of engineering students; and (4) assesses existing information resources, tools, and search techniques. Of practical significance, the authors apply student responses in the design of EISA, implement the EISA IL program for engineers, develop a series of tutorials, and propose a set of the four design principles.","1999","2018-06-20 14:12:50","2018-06-20 14:12:50","","450-461","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Accession Number: ISTA3403099; Ercegovac, Zorana; Source Info: October 31, 1999, Vol. 62, p450; Note: Update Code: 3410; Note: Conference Title: Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Information Science; Note: Conference Dates: 1999; Subject Term: ENGINEERING; Subject Term: INFORMATION literacy; Author-Supplied Keyword: Instruction; Author-Supplied Keyword: Models; Number of Pages: 12p; Document Type: Conference Paper</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1980's and 1990's, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), an accreditation agency serving primarily the United States, began to look at engineering programs outside of the United States with the intent of establishing recognized reciprocity. Through the Washington Accord, first established in 1989, mutual recognition agreements were signed with accrediting agencies in several countries. In the year 2000, heavily modified ABET standards affecting North America took effect emphasizing qualitative standards as well as quantitative ones. One aspect of the enhanced criteria that is particularly relevant to engineering and technology libraries is ""an understanding of ethical and professional responsibility"". Librarians have been providing essential instruction in ethics for many years through lessons in Information Literacy. Librarians can assist technological university administrations in adjusting to the emerging standards by partnering with faculty to incorporate lessons of ethical and professional responsibility into curricula.

The study examined information and technology usage habits and library skills of mathematics students. The study also identified the library/information services that mathematics students expect. The results from the survey have highlighted a host of questions and pedagogical issues relating to mathematics education. The results indicate that LaGuardia students' use of math-related websites or other math information resources is low. Technology is a standard element of education today and the field of mathematics needs to connect to existing and emerging learning technologies. The authors propose a three-pronged pedagogical model in which technology is integrated to teaching through web-based research, online communication, and student-authored multimedia projects. This approach, rooted in constructivist theory—where students build new knowledge upon pre-acquired experiences—is discussed, as well as potential instructional roles for both librarians and math instructors.

Increasingly, scientific discoveries are reported first in the patent literature, rather than in academic journals. To ensure that science students have the skills that match the information resources they will use as professionals, patent searching must become part of their information literacy instruction.

Design/methodology/approach - Two case studies, one undergraduate and one graduate, from two Canadian universities described the addition of patent searching to information literacy instruction in genetics and biotechnology. Findings - Results indicate that the integration of patents into information literacy sessions at the undergraduate and graduate levels not only enhance students' information literacy skills, but also help students learn more about the disciplines of genetics and biotechnology. Practical implications - The results of this paper have practical and pedagogical implications for librarians teaching students how to use patents as a primary source of scientific information in the life sciences and may provide useful information for any librarians who wish to introduce students to patents. Originality/value - While most of the literature about the integration of patent searching in information literacy instruction focuses on chemistry and engineering, this paper shows how integral patent information is to the life sciences, and how familiarity with patent searching can enhance student understanding of the scientific information environment.

This study also explores what faculty members think whose responsibility is to provide information literacy (IL) instructions. It will help to design better IL programs for the tertiary level students. This study used the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Science and Engineering/ Technology as the basis to assess these perceptions. For the purpose of this study NUST faculty teaching engineering students of post-graduate level were selected. They were the population of this study. A questionnaire based survey method was used to gather data required to answer the stated research questions and to achieve the objectives of this study. Questionnaires were sent to all teaching faculty members. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.0 was used to analyze the gathered data. Statistical techniques used include paired-samples t-test and ANOVA. The research indicates that faculty perceive information literacy skills of their PhD level students higher than those of MPhil level students. This study also indicates that the faculty is well aware of the importance of information literacy (IL) in their field and support the idea to impart its instructions. Though, they themselves use various methods and techniques for their students to go through information seeking process, however, they have also demonstrated a high level of interest in working with library professionals to expand these efforts.

The advent of the Web, the increased access to networked indexes, and what appears to be a confusion surrounding the Web, should give reason to reconsider library instruction methodology. An apparent confusion surrounding print and electronic, Web versus traditional indexes, and CAS Online versus other indexes prompted the re-tooling of the basic bibliographic instruction for chemistry at the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers University. Our sessions were revised to ensure that students would develop concrete critical thinking strategies that would serve them in their future studies or in the workplace.

While librarians face challenges ranging from new technologies to heightened expectations and fiscal difficulties, the key work remains in solid relationship building. Drawing on the experience of a group of subject librarians and teaching faculty at The Ohio State University, this study examines the qualities that help liaison librarians develop relationships with faculty and support ongoing library services. It explores how liaison librarians build opportunities for ongoing relationships and how they assess the successes or failures of those interactions. It chronicles interview findings that detail the importance of such skills as patience, expertise, follow-through, responsiveness, and individuality if librarians are to build solid relationships and fruitful collaborations. Finally, it offers some preliminary observations on the teaching faculty's understanding of the librarians' relationship-building efforts.","2017-04-01","2018-06-20 14:12:55","2018-06-20 14:12:55","","273","","2","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To appropriately frame the role of IT-based research tools in science curricula, we propose a framework that is developed to understand the use of tools in human activity, namely cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). Accordingly, IT-based research tools constitute central moments of scientific research activity and neither can be seen apart from its objectives, nor can it be considered apart from the cultural-historical determined forms of activity (praxis) in which human subjects participate. Based on empirical data involving students participating in research activity, we point out how an appropriate account of IT-based research tools involves subjects’ use of tools with respect to the objectives of research activity and the contribution to the praxis of research. We propose to reconceptualize the role of IT-based research tools as contributing to scientific literacy if students apply these tools with respect to the objectives of the research activity and contribute to praxis of research by evaluating and modifying the application of these tools. We conclude this paper by sketching the educational implications of this reconceptualized role of IT-based research tools.

This kind of literacy has been described in detail by Victor Showalter in 1975, expanded by others, and later defined succinctly by the OECD in 2003. As a complement, science literacy is described also by the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) as a content knowledge needed in setting up practical models for handling daily matters with science and engineering. These important and worthy aims were studied, and compared with reality and existing conditions. One hypothesis put forward and argued for is, that it is more realistic, considering existing trends, to aim for scientific and science awareness for the general student, while scientific and science literacy remain important and worthy aims for the common good of the global community, and important to be strived for by teachers, lecturers and intellectuals. The Basic Physics lectures can also lend themselves usefully for the more realistic aim, due to the science-based nature of the present knowledge society.

Business people such as Bill Gates warn that this alarming situation puts the United States at a serious disadvantage in the high-tech global marketplace of the twenty-first century, and President Obama places improvement in these areas at the center of his educational reform. What can be done to reverse this poor performance and to unleash America's wasted talent? David E. Drew has good news – and the tools America needs to keep competitive. Drawing on both academic literature and his own rich experience, Drew identifies proven strategies for reforming America's schools, colleges, and universities, and his comprehensive review of STEM education in the United States offers a positive blueprint for the future. These research-based strategies include creative and successful methods for building strong programs in science and mathematics education and show how the achievement gap between majority and minority students can be closed. A crucial measure, he argues, is recruiting, educating, supporting, and respecting America's teachers. To secure a competitive advantage both in the knowledge economy and in economic development more broadly, America needs a highly skilled, college-educated workforce and cutting-edge university research. Drew makes the case that reforming science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education to meet these demands, with an emphasis on reaching historically underserved students, is essential to the long-term prosperity of the United States.","2011","2018-06-20 14:12:57","2018-06-20 14:12:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Johns Hopkins University Press","Baltimore","English","","","","","","","","<p>ID: 694172101</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improved Capstone (ICap) was developed and implemented across the thermo-fluids topical area in the undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Technology Program at the University of Hartford. ICap experiential courses sequentially introduce challenging and open-ended assignments that foster cognitive learning. Using a scaffolding structure, assignments are organized into three modules: (1) classical, (2) transitional, and (3) design of an experiment. ICap enables students to assume greater responsibility for their learning experiences and liberates the instructor to become a mentor. Consequently, higher level skills important in the capstone course are strengthened: critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, teamwork, communications, information literacy, and design process.","2012","2018-06-20 14:12:57","2018-06-20 14:12:57","","3-10","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They find that these tools help novice researchers realize their information-seeking patterns and skills as well as potential gaps in their current practices. For students, a key outcome of harnessing their tacit information literacies is that it offers broader disciplinary relevance to their research projects, introducing them to the complexities of making claims and, most generally, the production of knowledge. For educators, identifying students' tacit information-seeking skills and shortcomings helps in the creation of assignments that further advance students' research skills.","2014","2018-06-20 14:12:58","2018-06-20 14:12:58","","403-423","","3","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>PT: J; NR: 15; TC: 0; J9: HARVARD EDUC REV; PG: 21; GA: AP2IU; UT: WOS:000341896700007</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a Likert-style survey administered pre- and postcourse, we found significant changes in students' confidence in their ability to read and analyze primary literature, self-assessed understanding of the nature of science, and epistemological beliefs (e. g., their sense of whether knowledge is certain and scientific talent innate). Thus, within a single semester, the inexpensive C. R. E. A. T.

The seminar's goals included 1.) refreshing and expanding faculty's knowledge of information and 21st century literacies and 2.) creating a community of faculty committed to developing student skills in finding, evaluating and synthesizing information in their academic coursework and into their professional careers. Overall, the seminar increased faculty understanding of services and expertise of the libraries, and 21st century literacies. It also developed and strengthened ties between individual faculty members and their subject librarians, leading to a mix of outcomes from a faculty member partnering on a grant the Libraries applied for to course integrated instruction sessions to faculty participating in an e-textbook pilot. This seminar provides a strong model for re-framing information literacy in the context of teaching and learning in science and engineering, giving librarians an opportunity to strengthen relationships and increase liaison effectiveness.

Predicated by the evolving nature of scholarship and research in the sciences, the reviewing task force strongly recommended that the standards be revised. This paper considers the broad recommendations of the task force, using the framework of e-Science – team-based, data-driven science – to address areas of necessary transformation in information literacy: an advanced team-based model that crosses disciplinary boundaries; a recognition that individuals and groups not only consume information, but also produce it; and stronger interplay between information literacy and complementary literacies. This paper also extrapolates beyond the sciences, referencing broader trends within higher education.

However, students often find decoding science in the media difficult, due to limited content knowledge and shifting definitions of accuracy. Faculty have developed a variety of approaches to increasing scientific literacy, but these approaches often miss out on valuable opportunities to teach core information literacy skills, including accessing original scientific research. We describe a scaffolded assignment using news reports that allows students enrolled in a science course for non-majors to learn about the nature of the scientific research literature, the connection between the popular press and the scientific literature, and the accuracy of popular media reporting of science while developing important information literacy skills. Our experience suggests that students develop information literacy skills associated with finding scientific articles using media reports, actively engage in trying to decode scientific articles, and are willing to thoughtfully assess the accuracy of science reporting in the news despite minimal content training. Moreover, students anecdotally report that the skills developed here are portable to decoding media reports from other academic fields of research, especially the social sciences.

Graduate students learn about bioinformatics databases in their laboratories, not the campus library, thereby bypassing the library and adopting the laboratory as their information community.

By focusing on the information behavior and information needs of women in STEM, this could lead to an increased use of academic library resources and services and even the development of specific services to meet the needs of women in STEM. The primary goal of this paper is to provide some preliminary findings on why there are so few women in the STEM fields. As a secondary goal this paper discusses the way that human information behavior can impact on the research behavior of male and female scientists in STEM and how this influences their use of libraries and research resources. Implications for LIS educators are suggested. LIS educators teaching future LIS practitioners are provided with some ideas to consider in terms of working with women in STEM and considering their information needs.

One potential solution is to address the high cost of textbooks. An alternative to the use of traditional textbooks in a class is the adoption of open textbooks. To determine the viability of open textbooks, one hundred and forty eight students who used an open textbook in an upper level Management Information Systems class were surveyed about their experience. This paper reports the results from the survey, addresses some concerns over the use of open textbooks and provides support for their place in the university curriculum. In general, there was satisfaction with the quality of the open textbook, the significant cost savings provided by using the open textbook versus a traditional textbook, the ease in accessing the open textbook online, and the overall experience with the open textbook. The findings provide support for those considering using open textbooks and relieve some of the concerns noted by faculty and students concerning the viability of this alternative to the traditional textbook. Discussion of the challenges faced by students and faculty members in the adoption of open textbooks is also provided.","","2018-06-20 14:14:29","2018-06-20 14:14:29","","66-76","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright Journal of Financial Education Fall 2014; DOCID: 3812796311; PCID: 99127472; PMID: 264528; ProvJournalCode: JCDB; PublisherXID: INNNJCDB0009914093</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges include paying for tuition and textbooks and finding a job upon graduation. These students are tech-savvy and seeking better ways to learn and retain material they learn in their classes. In addition, the textbook market is trying to evolve by serving this tech-generation through offering digital textbooks and other media-rich materials. New digital textbooks coupled with tablet e-readers are being used to help undergraduate students learn and retain information just as well as traditional paper textbooks. Undergraduate students have strong opinions about the use of paper and digital textbooks including the physical effects of digital e-readers, cost concerns for both formats of textbooks, and the features students want to see in e-readers. This study examined the effectiveness of using digital textbooks compared with traditional paper textbooks in undergraduate courses. Student performance comparisons were used to see if the digital versions have any significant influence on students’ achievement scores versus paper books and if there are any differences between genders. Moreover, regardless of performance outcomes, features of software and devices were explored to determine if these influence use of digital texts. Digital textbooks provide effective learning resources for undergraduate students at cost-effective prices. Features of digital e-readers can help students meet their learning goals and complete their coursework using new, interactive textbooks that pull together the content experts and multimedia.","2013","2018-06-20 14:14:29","2018-06-20 14:14:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Source type: dissertations&amp;theses; Object type: Dissertation; Object type: Thesis; Copyright: Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.; DOCID: 3066680971; PCID: 81555582; PMID: 66569; DocISBN: 9781303282300; DissertationNum: 3589517; PublisherXID: 3589517</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A nimble but careful move forward requires dependable partnerships, fresh thinking and a genuine understanding of the risks and rewards. To help make sense of the digital transition, this is an assessment of how course materials will evolve and Follett Higher Education Group's predictions for the near- and long-term future of digital learning.

The traditional purchase of printed textbooks from the campus bookstore still exists, but now students can purchase e-books, buy online, or rent from either the campus bookstore or from an online provider. This research is an exploratory study of college student textbook acquisition. In this paper, we review the literature regarding the textbook acquisition process. We developed and administered a survey instrument to examine students' textbook acquisition patterns. We find that most students acquire their textbooks using more than one source. Eighty six percent of the students surveyed use more than one source for textbooks. Of those students who rely on only one source, half use the campus bookstore. A majority of students use both the campus bookstore and an online retailer. We also observe that the student's year in school is somehow related to their acquisition method.

Design/methodology/approach - Students enrolled in one of 11 classes involved in the library's e-textbook pilot were recruited to complete an online survey including questions related to the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of electronic textbooks, as well as their general habits with the textbook. This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model as a framework for analysis. Findings - Students experienced a drop in enthusiasm for e-textbooks from the beginning to the end of the pilot. While research suggests that students prefer for print over electronic in some contexts, students rarely acted on that preference by seeking out available alternative print options. Student experience with the open/affordable textbook (FWK) was very comparable to that of the high cost commercial text (Nelson). Originality/value - While previous research suggests that students have a general preference for textbooks in print rather than electronic, the study suggests that preference may not dictate the likelihood that students will use print options. Students appear to be willing and able to easily make use of the content and functions in their e-textbooks. Despite overall positive reviews for the e-textbooks, students experienced a drop in enthusiasm for e-textbooks from the beginning to the end of the pilot.","","2018-06-20 14:14:30","2018-06-20 14:14:30","","65-82","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2015; DOCID: 3617712711; PCID: 94587512; PMID: 45886; ProvJournalCode: LIHT; PublisherXID: EMLDMLIHT20150101easeofuseandusefulness</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expansion of library course reserves has been suggested as one solution to this problem. The authors surveyed libraries at public universities to explore the status and management of physical course reserves and the role they play vis-a-vis textbook affordability. Both size and circulation of physical course reserve collections are declining. Despite a large growth in the use of electronic reserves, physical reserves play a significant role in providing textbooks for recommended reading lists. Physical course reserves represent a safety valve for students looking for ways to pay for college in an environment of ever-increasing textbook costs.

Further research revealed that: 100% of the titles requested by engineering students were identified as IT/Engineering textbooks according to the Departmental Textbook lists kept by the University Bookstore; the Mason Libraries already owned 76% of these titles; and 83% of the courses using these textbooks were either in the Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering departments. As a result of this analysis, the Engineering Textbook Reserves Program was conceived by the IT/Engineering Liaison Librarian and Access Services staff, including Reserves and ILL. The primary goals of this program, which was implemented during Fall Semester 2009, are: to help alleviate engineering student demand for textbooks borrowed through ILL by placing these titles on reserve; and to increase access to high demand engineering textbooks by more effectively utilizing existing library resources and services. Over the subsequent four semesters, seventy-one different titles have been placed on reserve for seventy different courses (86% of which were at graduate level). These books have been checked out over 1,500 times. Through careful monitoring, sixteen titles that were never borrowed were identified and removed from Reserve status. The program's goal of increasing access to high demand engineering textbooks was met and since Fall 2009, Mason Libraries realized a savings of approximately $16,800 in ILL borrowing costs for engineering textbooks. The purchase costs for new or updated editions of textbooks have been minimal. The total spent, $3,130.68, is approximately 3.0% of the total discretionary funds allocated for Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering purchases for FY2010 and FY2011.","","2018-06-20 14:14:33","2018-06-20 14:14:33","","509","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Feature; Object type: Article; Object type: Conference; CSAUnique: 55a33b02-7b15-4fbd-b688csamfg102v; AccNum: 18046478</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article synthesizes the results of 16 studies that examine either (1) the influence of OER on student learning outcomes in higher education settings or (2) the perceptions of college students and instructors of OER. Results across multiple studies indicate that students generally achieve the same learning outcomes when OER are utilized and simultaneously save significant amounts of money. Studies across a variety of settings indicate that both students and faculty are generally positive regarding OER.","","2018-06-20 14:14:33","2018-06-20 14:14:33","","573-590","","4","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2016; DOCID: 4157126471; PCID: 107072172; PMID: 13807; ProvJournalCode: ETRD; DOI: 10.1007/s11423-016-9434-9; PublisherXID: SPVLETRD114236449434</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As higher education evolves, one instructional tool, the classic textbook, is undergoing various transformations. In today's classrooms, many e-textbooks are in use and there are implications. Design/methodology/approach - A researcher-developed instrument measured 115 undergraduate students' satisfaction levels for e-textbooks used in two courses, and a learning styles instrument was given to identify student learning preferences. Findings - Through factor analysis, a few dimensions emerged regarding factors related to satisfaction. The factors included features, usability and learning facilitation provided by the e-textbooks. In general, students had a moderately above-neutral, positive attitude toward the e-textbooks. Gender, grade point average, time spent weekly reading e-textbooks and a few learning style tendencies can significantly predict, to some extent, different dimensions of satisfaction. Practical implications - Usability design of e-textbooks plays a key role in student satisfaction toward digital materials. Moreover, instructors need to use meaningful instructional activities as they adopt the usage of e-textbooks. Originality/value - The findings can help shed light on ways to enable students to become more satisfied with digital textbooks and can help policymakers and instructors evaluate and effectively adopt the appropriate digital materials to meet individual needs.","","2018-06-20 14:14:34","2018-06-20 14:14:34","","231-246","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2014; DOCID: 3678262451; PCID: 95918552; PMID: 124017; ProvJournalCode: JSTP; PublisherXID: EMLDJSTP20140101studentsatisfactiontowardetextbooksin</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These developments have increased the number of students visiting the library, which in turn has increased student use of library resources and services. As a result of this increase, demands for new services have also risen. During 2009, lending textbooks to students was considered. Traditional library collection development does not support textbook purchasing for various reasons, mainly due to the fact that textbooks are replaced with new editions and thus it does not serve a long-term value to the library collection. However, as the library faced a growing demand for textbooks, they began to see a connection between the needs of their students and its student-centered library service philosophy.

An evaluation was done to determine how frequently students use interlibrary loan to request textbooks at Wichita State University, the costs of such requests, and whether or not a textbook collection within the library offered a solution to this issue.","","2018-06-20 14:14:35","2018-06-20 14:14:35","","5-18","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; CSAUnique: CSATECH-0f13cb79-5fe9-414f-bc0bmfgefd114; AccNum: 18050590; DOI: 10.1080/1072303X.2013.769040; ISSN: 1072-303X; ElecISSN: 1540-3572</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include monetary, security, and other issues. There is also the question of electronic reserve. A major problem could be that students would try to rely only on the library copies rather than purchasing their own, making these copies hard to keep on the shelves. In our college, the lack of security gates provides an opportunity for the books to go missing. There are, however, definite pluses for the student.

The Library Can Help: A Program for the Long-Term Lending of Textbooks in Your Academic Library","Texas Library Journal","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/1429833863?accountid=14692","Not only are textbooks expensive to begin with; their rising cost relative to other things tends, over time, to push textbook ownership into the category of an unreachable necessity for a large pool of students. School administrators understand that these circumstances exist. In fact, most schools probably have an unpublicized and informal program in place for the relief of these students. The idea behind the textbook loan program under review in this article is to take the president's office out of the picture, and let the library help more students. The library's takeover of the program also means that the library buys the textbooks when it does not already own them and keeps them to lend again, instead of the student keeping them. Also, when the library runs the program, campus administration can be certain that a service center with a long history of buying and accessioning books, and tracking their loan status, will handle the job as part of normal business. The program can be run by one person, it is complex. Meeting this challenge implies a number of important library competencies in the areas of circulation, customer service, and marketing.

Before installation, it is sensible to learn from the scholarly communication area that suffers from the cost of digitization, without effective countermeasures or policies to deal with the demanding commercial companies. Introduction of digital contents may introduce digital divide among schools, counteracting the notion of fair education. Often overlooked is the change in payment methods. Whereas paper books can be physically owned once it is purchased, digital contents may require additional costs for maintaining access rights or updates. In addition, information literacy will be necessary. Notable examples are public libraries circulating digital books and university libraries contracting with academic journals. Both libraries suffer from increasing costs after the introduction of digital contents. Switching textbooks requires substantial effort even in the case of paper. We need to carefully consider the consequence of digitization from various aspects such as the running or vendor-switching cost and the information literacy.","","2018-06-20 14:14:36","2018-06-20 14:14:36","","755-762","","10","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; CSAUnique: CSATECH-bf974ae6-61b4-4873-891a-da3e5512cd25; AccNum: PQ0002454855; ISSN: 0021-7298; ElecISSN: 1347-1597; Peer Reviewed: true</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer a promise of reducing the overall costs of education, open textbooks present another. College students have long complained about the exorbitant prices of required texts, with several reports indicating that students currently spend approximately $1,000 per year on these books. It is these prices that propel students into academic libraries every term, seeking copies that can be borrowed rather than bought. There, they discover that libraries do not generally purchase commercial textbooks because they take up space, they change every term, and they are expensive.

A survey was sent out to 2,074 students in 13 courses using the OAERs. A total of 524 (25.3%) students completed the survey and a faculty member from each of the 13 courses using OAERs was interviewed. Students rated the OAERs as good quality, preferred using them instead of buying textbooks for their courses, and agreed that they would like OAERs used in other courses. Faculty felt that student learning was somewhat better and it was somewhat easier to teach using OAERs than when they used the traditional textbooks. Nearly all faculty members preferred teaching with OAERs and planned to continue to do so after the funding period. These results, combined with the tremendous savings to students, support the continued funding of the initiative and similar approaches at other institutions.

The original digital textbook can be fabricated relatively easily by using Epub or DAISY. Print textbooks are, however, employed as textbooks in the most of lectures in universities. Therefore, it is considered necessary to convert the content of the print textbook to the digital textbook simply and in a short time. In this paper, the digital textbook using PDF files of the print textbook was suggested as one of simple and practical solution to provide an alternative textbook for the physically disabled university student who has difficulty handling the print textbook. Then usability of the suggested method was evaluated experimentally from the point of workload. Result of the experiment indicates that the digital textbook fabricated as the alternative one for the print textbook by the suggested method has a potential to reduce workload for the physically disabled university students. In addition, the digital textbook with larger LCD display needs less workload than the print textbook. Then, there are not so much difference in the workload between the print book which is smaller than the print textbook and the digital book made from the print book.","","2018-06-20 14:14:37","2018-06-20 14:14:37","","3-10","","","217","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Source type: scholarlyjournals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; CSAUnique: MEDL-26294446; AccNum: 26294446; ISSN: 0926-9630; PMID: 26294446; Peer Reviewed: true</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The student is Luke Thomas, a senior majoring in business on the Orono campus, who last semester took a 250-person introductory English course called ""The Nature of Story."" The required textbook was compiled by the professor, John R. Wilson, and published by Cengage. Mr. Wilson also asked students to purchase access to online supplementary materials that came bundled with new copies of the textbook. Total price tag for the book and an access code to get to the online system: $150. Mr. Thomas was taking the course with his then-fiancee (now wife), so he hoped to buy just one textbook they could share. The trick, though, was that each student in the course needed his or her own access code to get to the online discussion board and homework-submission system. And Mr. Thomas was told by the professor and by officials at the campus bookstore that the textbook and code came only as a package deal, meaning the couple would have to pay $300 to get the two access codes and an extra book they didn't need. In the good-old days when print was the only option, students had plenty of free or cheap ways to get required textbooks. Borrow one from a friend. Check out a copy from the library. Buy a used copy for a fraction of the price. Or rent a copy through one of several companies providing that service. But the latest textbook enhancements, which require individual access codes to get to bonus materials online, threaten to displace all of those alternatives. Most access codes are good only for a limited time, and once they are activated they can't be used by other students. In some cases, publishers charge almost as much for the access code alone as they do for a new printed textbook. It's common sense that things that are digital should be less expensive and better for consumers. But with textbooks, the underlying problem with the market is the fact that publishers get to set the price of textbooks without any input from students because students need to buy whatever they're assigned. In other areas, if students don't like the price they can go buy something else. The majority of university courses still use printed textbooks without requiring online supplements.

Where other check-lists compare a list to the collection, ignoring the number of items which do not appear on the list, an inductive method takes a sample of the entire collection, and compares it with several evaluative lists, demonstrating what percentage of the collection is not considered ""desirable"" by common evaluative lists.Findings - The results found that 31.9 percent of the LFPL's GLBT collection can be found in the evaluative lists used. Previous inductive evaluations suggest that this number indicates a quality core GLBT collection.Research limitations implications - A sample collection was chosen using GLBT-related subject headings; however, evidence shows that a portion of the actual GLBT collection (perhaps as much as 37.5 percent) lack appropriate subject access control. This results in a potentially flawed sample.Practical implications - This study provides public librarians with a standard by which they can evaluate their GLBT collections and their library's attempt to meet the needs of a frequently underrepresented minority.Originality value - Very few inductive evaluations have been published, and almost none has been published studying GLBT collections. The paper attempts to fill that gap, and provide a deeper standard by which GLBT collections can be evaluated.","2008-10-03","2018-06-20 14:15:24","2018-06-20 14:15:24","","149-156","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BHRLE4BE\Moss - 2008 - An inductive evaluation of a public library GLBT c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It will equip professionals at institutions with mental health programs that deal with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues with information and insight to help psychologists, mental health clinicians, and counselors better serve the LGBT populations that, increasingly, are seeking their services. The book begins with introductory chapters that present an overview of the field, chronicle the relationship between the LGBT community and the field of psychology in past decades, and identify emerging issues covered in the volume. It then addresses subjects such as social psychology and LGBT populations, health disparities and LGBT populations, the evolution of developmental theory related to the LBGT populations, emerging policy issues in LGBT health and psychology, and recent efforts to make the field of psychology more trans-inclusive and affirmative. Chapters are also dedicated to examining contemporary, LGBT-affirmative psychoanalysis and treating addictions and substance abuse in the LGBT community. The book concludes with chapters that address how the concept of intersectionality can serve as a way to better understand LGBT members who possess multiple cultural identities and the unique stressors they experience in daily life. The final chapter summarizes issues that bridge the contributions provided by the authors, and it highlights current issues of focal concern in order to project future directions for the field of LGBT psychology in the next two decades.","2017-10-27","2018-06-20 14:15:27","2018-06-20 14:15:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Praeger","Santa Barbara","English","","","","","","","","<p>reading list</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It covers the waterfront of intricate and thorny issues regarding intellectual freedom, including determining strategies for patron privacy, deciding how to filter public computers, handling challenges to items in a collection, and recognizing and eliminating under-the-radar self-censorship during collection development and weeding. Readers will also gain an understanding of the perils of over-reliance on community assessments and other evaluative tools and consider important concerns of public library employees, such as whether to restrict borrowing privileges of R-rated movies and M-rated video games to patrons of various ages, and the legalities that surround these questions. Each chapter blends instructive background narrative with practical advice, research findings, and relevant information about librarianship's professional guidelines, including the ALA's Library Bill of Rights and the Freedom to Read Statement. Vignettes, """"what would you do?"""" examples, effective nonconfrontational techniques for conflict resolution, and lists of tips and traps help readers to think critically about their own biases and rehearse possible responses to controversial situations. Librarians, library staff, and MLIS students can use this book for personal professional development, as supplemental reading for MLIS courses or professional training workshops, or as a resource for library policy-planning discussions.","2017-07-28","2018-06-20 14:15:29","2018-06-20 14:15:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","Libraries Unlimited","Englewood","English","","","","","","","","<p>eBook</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, women are well represented at the Ph.D. level in some sciences and poorly represented in some humanities (e.g., in 2011, 54% of U.S. Ph.D.'s in molecular biology were women versus only 31% in philosophy). We hypothesize that, across the academic spectrum, women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. This hypothesis extends to African Americans' underrepresentation as well, as this group is subject to similar stereotypes.

Increasingly, researchers are looking to gender differences in STEM attitudes as the root of this disparity. Theoretical support for the importance of STEM attitudes comes from several theories within educational, social, and vocational psychology, including Eccles' expectancy-value theory, which maintains that education-related choices are shaped by attitudesnamely, expectations of success and task value as well as self-concept. Yet, the studies testing this model generally have not taken into account the intersection of gender and ethnicity. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by describing gender differences in math and science attitudes and achievement among 367 White, African American, Latino/Latina, and Asian American 10th grade students in neighborhood public high schools from a large northeastern city. Male and female adolescents earned similar end-of-year grades in math and science, whereas Asian American students outperformed students from the other ethnic groups in math and science. Self-report data from paper-and-pencil surveys indicate significant gender differences in that male adolescents reported greater math self-concept and expectations of success and female adolescents reported more science value; gender differences did not vary across ethnic groups. Attitudes were strong predictors of achievement, consistent with hypotheses. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity across four major ethnic groups. We discuss implications for efforts aimed at improving the representation of women in STEM.","2013-09","2018-06-25 16:03:49","2018-06-25 16:03:49","","293-309","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rationale for this article is based upon disproportionate representation among undergraduate physics majors in the United States; women earned only 19.7% of physics undergraduate degrees in 2012. This disparity has been attributed to a variety of factors, including unwelcoming classroom atmospheres, low confidence and self-efficacy, and few female role models in physics academic communities. Recent empirical studies have suggested gender disparities in physics and related STEM fields may be more amenable to social cognitive interventions than previously thought. Social psychologists have found that women improved physics self-concept when adopting a malleable view of intelligence, when they received support and encouragement from family and teachers, and when they experienced interactive learning techniques in communal environments. By exploring research-based evidence for strategies to support women in physics, precollege and university faculty and administrators may apply social cognitive constructs to improve the representation of women in the field.","2016-08-01","2018-06-25 16:03:49","2018-06-25 16:03:49","","UNSP 020116","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, this increase in student diversity does not always occur alongside changes in institutional culture. Unexamined biases in institutional culture can prevent diverse students from thriving and persisting in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Given the daily personal interactions that faculty have with students, we suggest that individual educators have the opportunity, and responsibility, to improve the retention and persistence of diverse students. However, in our experience, faculty professional development programs often limit discussions of diversity to ""comfortable"" topics (such as learning styles) and miss opportunities to explore deeper issues related to faculty privilege, implicit bias, and cues for stereotype threat that we all bring to the classroom. In this essay, we present a set of social science concepts that we can extend to our STEM courses to inform our efforts at inclusive excellence. We have recommended strategies for meaningful reflection and professional development with respect to diversity and inclusion, and aim to empower faculty to be change agents in their classrooms as a means to broadening participation in STEM fields.","2016-09-01","2018-06-25 16:03:49","2018-06-25 16:03:49","","es3","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One-hundred undergraduate women who were not computer science majors met a female or male peer role model who embodied computer science stereotypes in appearance and stated interests or the same role model who did not embody these stereotypes. Participants and role models engaged in an interaction that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Interest in majoring in computer science was assessed following the interaction and 2 weeks later outside the laboratory. Results revealed that exposure to the stereotypical role model had both an immediate and an enduring negative effect on women's interest in computer science. Differences in interest at both times were mediated by women's reduced sense of belonging in computer science upon interacting with the stereotypical role model. Gender of the role model had no effect. Whether a potential role model conveys to women a sense of belonging in the field may matter more in recruiting women into computer science than gender of the role model. Long-term negative effects of exposure to computer scientists who fit current stereotypes in the media and elsewhere may help explain current gender disparities in computer science participation.","2013-03","2018-06-25 16:03:49","2018-06-25 16:03:49","","72-79","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These gaps occur in both traditional and interactive-engagement (IE) styles of physics instruction. We investigated one gender gap in the area of attitudes and beliefs. This was men's and women's physics self-efficacy, which comprises students' thoughts and feelings about their capabilities to succeed as learners in physics. According to extant research using pre-and post-course surveys, the self-efficacy of both men and women tends to be reduced after taking traditional and IE physics courses. Moreover, self-efficacy is reduced further for women than for men. However, it remains unclear from these studies whether this gender difference is caused by physics instruction. It may be, for instance, that the greater reduction of women's self-efficacy in physics merely reflects a broader trend in university education that has little to do with physics per se. We investigated this and other alternative causes, using an in-the-moment measurement technique called the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). We used ESM to collect multiple samples of university students' feelings of self-efficacy during four types of activity for two one-week periods: (i) an introductory IE physics course, (ii) students' other introductory STEMcourses, (iii) their non-STEM courses, and (iv) their activities outside of school. We found that women experienced the IE physics course with lower self-efficacy than men, but for the other three activity types, women's self-efficacy was not reliably different from men's. We therefore concluded that the experience of physics instruction in the IE physics course depressed women's self-efficacy. Using complementary measures showing the IE physics course to be similar to others in which gendered self-efficacy effects have been consistently observed, we further concluded that IE physics instruction in general is likely to be detrimental to women's self-efficacy. Consequently, there is a clear need to redress this inequity in IE physics, and probably also in traditional instruction.","2016-08-01","2018-06-25 16:03:50","2018-06-25 16:03:50","","UNSP 020105","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mentors and mentoring are the most important vehicles by which the talents of young scientists are developed. However, mentoring as a teaching and learning paradigm is very complex and idiosyncratic, and often inadvertently fails to provide the same quality and quantity of opportunity to aspiring scientists who are 'different' from those doing the mentoring. This article provides a theoretical and practical framework for understanding how differences of race, ethnicity, gender, skin color, social status and other identifiable characteristics can play into scientific development during mentoring 'within the pipeline'. It also serves as a foundation upon which mentoring in AIDS is considered by subsequent papers in this series. Finally, it goes beyond mentoring to propose systematic coaching as an effective complement to research mentoring to promote success, especially for individuals from underrepresented groups.","2016-09","2018-06-25 16:03:50","2018-06-25 16:03:50","","S237","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research reported here addresses first-generation college students' discipline of study (e.g., biology) and its impact on their persistence. Exploring how female, low-income, first-generation college students evaluate their persistence within undergraduate science learning environments contributes to understanding how gender and social class influence persistence in STEM fields. Two White, female, low-income, first-generation college students were interviewed during their last year in college. Using constant comparative coding methods and Ricoeur's (Ricoeur [1984] Time and narrative, Volume I (K. McLaughlin & D. Pellauer, Trans.). Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press) description of narrative construction, common tensions were identified related to participants' descriptions of undergraduate science as competitive. These persistence-related tensions are (1) differing experiences in lecture and lab, (2) managing time to work, study, and maintain family relationships, and (3) weighing their personal (family) priorities against the longer time it would take them to reach their science-related career goals. These tensions depict a traditional undergraduate science learning environment focused on individuals and abstract knowledge that positions female lower-income students as academic non-competitors because of the importance of kinship ties and physical skills in their cultural background (Lareau [2002] American Sociological Review 67(5), 747-776; Lareau [2003] Unequal childhoods: Class, race, and family life. Berkeley: University of California Press). The participants' experiences support that the gendered and classed expectations needed to succeed in a science environment could be somewhat alleviated through reforms to traditional lecture and laboratory undergraduate science courses that promote cooperative student learning groups and integration of lecture with hands-on activities.

Fifty studies on student attrition from engineering programs were included in the primary part of this literature review. In the second half of the work, an additional twenty-five studies that focused on methods of increasing student retention, were examined. Six broad factors driving students to leave engineering were identified by examining the attrition literature: classroom and academic climate, grades and conceptual understanding, self-efficacy and self-confidence, high school preparation, interest and career goals, and race and gender. Evidence from the retention studies suggests that successful efforts to increase retention act on one or more of these factors.

First, we surveyed 80 Native American STEM freshmen and found they more highly endorsed communal goals than individualistic work goals. Next, we surveyed 96 Native American and White American students in STEM and non-STEM majors and confirmed that both Native American men and women in STEM highly endorsed communal goals. In a third study, we conducted a follow-up survey and in-depth interviews with a subset of Native American STEM students in their second semester to assess their experiences of belonging uncertainty, intrinsic motivation, persistence intentions, and perceived performance in STEM as a function of their initial communal work goals. Results demonstrate the prominence of communal goals among incoming Native American freshman (especially compared with White male STEM majors) and the connection between communal goals and feelings of belonging uncertainty, low motivation, and perceived poor performance 1 semester later. The interview data illustrate that these issues are particularly salient for students raised within tribal communities, and that a communal goal orientation is not just a vague desire to ""help others,"" but a commitment to helping their tribal communities.

Prior cross-national research finds that gender stratification in education, work, and politics in a country affects the size of male-favourable gender gaps on math and science achievement tests for adolescents. Countries with more gender equality have smaller gender gaps in math and science. But, it is unknown how gender stratification or cultural ideologies impact the development of boys' and girls' STEM career expectations.

METHODS We use Cox proportional hazards models and multinomial logistic regression to examine gendered associations between field of study and the three transitions among college graduates of the NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) cohort. RESULTS Men majoring in STEM achieve early transitions to full-time work, marriage, and parenthood; women majoring in STEM show no significant advantage in finding full-time work and delayed marriage and childbearing; women in business have earlier transitions to full-time work and marriage than women in other fields, demonstrating an advantage similar to that of men in STEM. CONCLUSIONS The contrast between men and women in STEM shows that transition to adulthood remains gendered; the contrast between women in STEM and women in business illustrates that a prestigious career may not necessarily delay family formation. CONTRIBUTION The paper shows how stratification by field of study creates gendered demographic outcomes for college graduates. It also demonstrates that women's decisions regarding marriage and parenthood do not uniformly respond to the economic prospect of their work.","2016-09-28","2018-06-25 16:03:52","2018-06-25 16:03:52","","929-959","","","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These predictors include credits earned in math and science courses as well as ACT math scores. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of U.S. young adults who were 12th graders in 2004 and disclosed their college majors by 2006, logistic regression analyses revealed that students who took more units in computer science courses were significantly more likely to choose STEM majors in both 4-year and 2-year post-secondary institutions. Moreover, regardless of the type of postsecondary institutions that students attended, taking more units in computer science courses played a significant role in choosing STEM majors. In addition, the effects of computer science education on student STEM major selection were equally as strong as the effects of math and science education. The results suggest that promoting the quality of computer science education is just as important in motivating students to pursue STEM education and career choices at the secondary level as are math and science education.

The ePEP helped them identify programs of study and required high school coursework to accomplish their postsecondary education and career goals. During the same period Florida required completion of the ePEP, Florida's Career and Professional Education Act stimulated a rapid increase in the number of statewide high school career academies. Students with interests in STEM careers created STEM-focused ePEPs and may have enrolled in STEM career academies, which offered a unique opportunity to improve their preparedness for the STEM workforce through the integration of rigorous academic and career and technical education courses. This study examined persistence of STEM-interested (i.e., those with expressed interest in STEM careers) and STEM-capable (i.e., those who completed at least Algebra 1 in eighth grade) students (n = 11,248), including those enrolled in STEM career academies, in rigorous mathematics and science course taking in Florida public high schools in comparison with the national cohort of STEM-interested students to measure the influence of K-12 STEM education efforts in Florida. With the exception of multi-race students, we found that Florida's STEM-capable students had lower persistence in rigorous mathematics and science course taking than students in the national cohort from ninth to eleventh grade.

The study found that while the department placed an emphasis on research, it did so in a way that, in conjunction with a lack of communication and transparency, devalued teaching and mentoring, and negatively impacted the professional development, education, and sense of belonging of the students. As one part of a multi-phase case study spanning over a decade, this manuscript presents preliminary findings from our latest work at the university. We detail early comparisons between data gathered at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005 and our most recent pilot case study, a follow-up research project completed in 2016. Though we have not yet completed the full data collection, we find it worthwhile to reflect on the pilot case study data we have collected thus far. Our data reveals improvements in the perceptions of undergraduate teaching quality and undergraduate peer mentoring networks. However, we also found evidence of continuing feelings of isolation, incidents of bias, policy opacity, and uneven policy implementation that are areas of concern, particularly with respect to historically underrepresented groups.

Using 11th grade students' high-stake test results in reading, mathematics, and science, this article compares the achievement outcomes of both school types. In answering the research questions related to student success for attendees of either STEM or traditional schools, this research concluded that success with reading, mathematics, and science high-stake tests for students does not differ by school type. However, student demographic variables (gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and special education status) may influence the success of students attending STEM schools.

Is the relation between stereotype threat and grades robust in naturalistic settings, specifically in introductory STEM courses? We gathered data on two new measures we term race and sex stereotype bias, which were administered four times over the course of introductory chemistry and biology courses for STEM majors (N = 1358). Patterns of growth for all stereotype bias measures showed a discontinuous pattern, with increases during each semester (fall and spring) and decreases between semesters. For all stereotype bias measures, sophomores scored significantly higher than freshmen, and juniors scored in between. For the sex stereotype bias measure, females scored significantly higher than males. There were no race or sex differences on slopes of growth; though groups began at different levels, all grew at the same rate. There was little relation between grades and stereotype bias when analyzed by race; Asian students showed the largest number of significant - albeit small - correlations (3) and Black students the fewest (none). Correlations between grades and sex stereotype bias were significant and negative - but small - only for males. Results support a point made by Steele in 1997 but neglected since then; stereotype threat may affect only a small sub-portion within stereotyped groups. We argue that variables other than stereotype threat might be better targets for research attempting to explain gaps in STEM achievement and retention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

From the perspective of new institutionalism, we investigate the moderating effects of hierarchically situated higher education institutions and labor market sectors on the economic disparity between STEM and non-STEM majors by pooling data from two nationwide representative surveys collected in contemporary urban China. The results of median regression models suggest that (1) On average, STEM majors are more lucrative than non-STEM majors in Reform-Era China, a pattern resembling that of many other societies. (2) The vertical stratification of higher education institutions, i.e., the postsecondary education sector's segmentation into ""junior"" and ""regular"" colleges, is relevant, where a smaller STEM advantage over non-STEM fields is detected among junior college graduates after accounting for potential cohort variation. Moreover, this moderating effect of college tiers declines across birth cohorts. (3) Working in the state sector, such as the Communist Party and government department and institutions, relative to the other sectors, significantly narrows the earnings gap between STEM and non-STEM graduates.

It is suspected that gender stereotypes hinder the electoral success of female candidates, but empirical evidence is inconclusive on whether stereotypes have a direct effect on voting decisions. This empirical conflict stems, in part, from the assumption that voters automatically rely on gender stereotypes when evaluating female candidates. This study explicitly tests the assumption of automatic stereotype activation. I suggest that stereotype reliance depends on whether stereotypes have been activated during a campaign, and it is only when stereotypes are activated that they influence evaluations of female candidates. These hypotheses are tested with a survey experiment and observational analysis. The results show that campaign communication activates stereotypes when they otherwise might not be activated, thereby diminishing support for female candidates.","2015-12","2018-06-25 16:03:53","2018-06-25 16:03:53","","691-708","","6","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicate that racial-ethnic and gender underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are interrelated and should be examined with attention to the intersecting factors influencing female and racial-ethnic minority adolescents' pathways toward careers in these fields. Among those who major in PEMC fields, women closely resemble men with respect to their subjective orientations. The effects of subjective orientations on women's chances of majoring in PEMC vary by their secondary school mathematics course completion levels. Women who take more mathematics courses are more likely to major in PEMC; however, course taking alone does not attenuate gender disparities in declaring these majors. High mathematics ability (as measured by standardized test scores in the 10th grade) appears to be positively associated with women's selection of social, behavioral, clinical, and health science majors. This association is less robust (and slightly negative) for women in PEMC. While advanced course taking appears to assist women in selecting PEMC majors, women who enter these fields may not be as strong as those who select other, less male-dominated scientific fields.","2012-11","2018-06-25 16:03:54","2018-06-25 16:03:54","","1658-1673","","6","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings indicate that math- and science-related course selection patterns are strongly associated with ethnicity, qualified not only by gender and prior math and science achievement but also by the individual's grade level at entry to the system and enrollment in English as a Second Language program. Students who are more likely to engage in math and science courses belong to Asian ethno-linguistic groups and entered the provincial school system during the senior high-school years.

The conclusions reached suggest that, despite improvement in recent years, women and minorities still face complex barriers to STEM academic careers, and further research is needed to determine the best solutions to this problem.","2017-03","2018-06-25 16:03:55","2018-10-26 20:17:36","","fnx057","","6","364","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>; <p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine three types of confidence and find that confidence measured by expected ranking is the most important determinant of decisions to enter tournaments. Conditional on ability, this measure eliminates gender differences in winner-take-all tournaments and, when entered with risk measures, eliminates differences in ranked compensation tournaments. When the sample is split by career choice, there are no gender differences for students in STEM fields, and in the humanities and the social sciences differences can be explained by confidence. However, for business school students, gender differences in willingness to compete in winner-take-all tournaments persist even after accounting for risk aversion and confidence. Men in business set themselves apart from the rest of the population (men and women alike) with the highest levels of tournament entry and the most positive performance responses to competition.

This disturbing trend, observed in many countries, is more serious and evident in American universities and is reflected in the U.S. workforce statistics. In this article, we examine historical students' interest data in order to further the understanding of this discrepancy and to suggest methods to reverse this trend. Thirty years of historical ACT data were analyzed by expressed interest patterns, ACT scores, gender, and intended college major or career aspiration. Statistical package for the social sciences software was used to analyze the data and examine the historical trends of students' expressed interest in STEM-related careers. Results show that there is a significant (although expected) discrepancy between the number of male and female students who expressed interest in engineering majors and careers. Significant changes have also been observed in the interest in engineering fields over time, most likely because of societal influences. These influences are most profound in computer-related fields, causing speculation that both males and females were influenced by the dot com era but that only male interest was piqued due to the rise of computer gaming in the late 1990s. Students are further grouped into three categorieswell prepared (ACT 28), under prepared (27 ACT 19), and unprepared (ACT < 19). Of the total number of students who expressed interest in engineering majors, there are many who appear either completely unprepared or relatively under prepared for the demands of these fields. Data show that female students who expressed interest in STEM fields are generally in the well-prepared category; the discrepancy between those who are interested but under prepared is greater in males than females. Results from this analysis demonstrate the importance of earlier interventions to encourage students who still have enough time to get prepared for opportunities that interest them. It is also probable that students are making assumed career choices based on little or no data and may actually find their interest waning very quickly (thus making them a retention risk if they are admitted to an engineering program). This study, therefore, provides a better understanding of gender, societal influences, and ability disparities in high school students who expressed interest in engineering majors and careers. Obtained results suggested some of what needs to be done and could be used to guide future efforts in order to reverse the current trends of gender disparity and lack of female interest in engineering fields.","2013-11","2018-06-25 16:03:55","2018-06-25 16:03:55","","599-613","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One explanation for this phenomenon is stereotype threat: that females are intimidated by the persistent negative stereotypes about women in STEM fields. Examining the inception and development of stereotype threat among young children is crucial for understanding and bridging the STEM gender gap. Two experiments investigated the effect of stereotype threat on performance on a spatial task among children ages 4 to 10. After a gender identity activation manipulation, children replicated a series of designs with LEGO blocks. In Experiment 1 (N = 22), 4-yearold girls whose gender identity was activated were significantly slower than girls whose gender identity was not activated. In Experiment 2 (N = 160), boys and girls in kinder-garten through third grade did not perform differently in stereotype-threat conditions or a condition where gender was not activated. However, girls were consistently slower at the block-construction task than boys. In addition, older children's speed was predicted by their stereotypical attitudes towards LEGO blocks, whether their favorite toy was LEGO blocks, and how frequently they played with blocks at home. Results suggest that gender stereotypes affect children's performance on a gendered activity as early as age 4 and may be continuously affecting older girls' performance. Implications for understanding precursors of the STEM gender gap are discussed.","2014","2018-06-25 16:03:56","2018-06-25 16:03:56","","53-77","","3-4","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we review and discuss current research on STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that different social factors affect the two major components of STEM education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b) attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels. However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES) predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological factors are more important influences on participation and achievement in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally, American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require more research, a task that is best accomplished through interdisciplinary approaches.","2015","2018-06-25 16:03:56","2018-06-25 16:03:56","","331-357","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gender disparity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education continues to exist in higher education, with male professors holding a normative position. This disparity can also be seen in the United Arab Emirates. As female participation in STEM education lags behind men, it is possible that gender stereotypes may influence students' first impressions of male and female instructors. The United Arab Emirates provides a unique context to study this phenomenon as it is a traditional patriarchal society that is highly dependent on the engineering discipline, especially within the oil and gas sectors. A total of 176 undergraduate students from 2 universities in the United Arab Emirates completed a survey about teaching effectiveness based on their perceptions of photographs of hypothetical male and female instructors. A factor analysis of survey items revealed 2 main subcategories of teacher effectiveness: namely teacher warmth and professionalism. A 2-way between-groups analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact of teacher gender and student gender on perceptions of overall teaching effectiveness, as well as their perceptions of teacher warmth and professionalism.

Men outperform women on the h index and its two components: scientific productivity and citations of contributions. To interpret these gender gaps, we first evaluate whether publication metrics are affected by gender bias in obtaining grant support, publishing papers, or gaining citations of published papers.

The gender gap in mathematics and science performance has converged, and so it is important to consider the motivational reasons that might underlie the differential STEM pursuits of women and men. The goal congruity perspective contends that a fundamental cause of gender gaps in STEM pursuits is the gender difference in communal motivation (i.e., an orientation toward others). STEM fields may be particularly likely to deter communally oriented individuals because these fields are thought to impede goals of directly benefitting others, altruism, or collaboration. In this review, we examine how the communal goal perspective might address the challenges of gender gaps in STEM pursuits from childhood through adulthood. We review the logic and evidence for the goal congruity perspective, and we examine two other deterrents to women in STEMwork-family challenges and stereotypingfrom the perspective of this framework. We then examine particular recommendations for policy actions that might broaden participation of women and girls, and communally oriented people generally, in STEM.","2015-01","2018-06-25 16:03:58","2018-06-25 16:03:58","","52-88","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals a more nuanced picture, however, with women achieving parity with men at the Ph.D. level in certain STEM fields, while also being underrepresented in some non-STEM fields. It is important to consider and provide an account of this field-by-field variability. The field-specific ability beliefs (FAB) hypothesis aims to provide such an account, proposing that women are likely to be underrepresented in fields thought to require raw intellectual talent a sort of talent that women are stereotyped to possess less of than men. In two studies, we provide evidence for the FAB hypothesis, demonstrating that the academic fields believed by laypeople to require brilliance are also the fields with lower female representation. We also found that the FABs of participants with college-level exposure to a field were more predictive of its female representation than those of participants without college exposure, presumably because the former beliefs mirror more closely those of the field's practitioners (the direct ""gatekeepers""). Moreover, the FABs of participants with college exposure to a field predicted the magnitude of the field's gender gap above and beyond their beliefs about the level of mathematical and verbal skills required. Finally, we found that beliefs about the importance of brilliance to success in a field may predict its female representation in part by fostering the impression that the field demands solitary work and competition with others. These results suggest new solutions for enhancing diversity within STEM and across the academic spectrum.","2015-03-11","2018-06-25 16:03:59","2018-06-25 16:03:59","","235","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to the financial and health benefits, increasing the number of girls and women in STEM fields may also indirectly prevent and/or reduce teen dating violence and intimate partner violence by: (1) increasing women's financial independence, thereby reducing dependence on potentially abusive partners; (2) decreasing household poverty and financial stress, which may lead to reductions in relationship discord; and (3) increasing attitudes and beliefs about women as equals, thereby increasing gender equity. In this commentary, we discuss the potential role of primary and secondary school STEM programs in reducing violence against women.

Socioeconomic status, race, gender, and sexuality influenced early expectations about work and the process through which these expectations developed. Women from white and Latino working-class families were evenly divided in their expectations about their future workforce participation, while the vast majority of white, Asian, African American, and Latina middle-class women expected to work continually as adults. Unlike their working-class white and Hispanic peers, all of the working-class Black respondents developed expectations that they would work continuously as adults.

We wanted to explore the role that teaching Build IT may have played in activating or reactivating interest in careers in computer science and to see whether in the years following implementation of Build IT, these women pursued STEM education and/or careers. We reached nine facilitators who implemented the program in 2011-12 or shortly after. Many indicated that while facilitating Build IT, they learned along with the participants, increasing their interest in and confidence with technology and computer science. Seven of the nine participants pursued further STEM or computer science learning or modified their career paths to include more of a STEM or computer science focus.

Students completed baseline perfectionism scales and repeated measures for perceived academic stress at monthly intervals 3 times in the fall semester and 3 times in the spring semester. Course grade data from institutional records were used to calculate first-year STEM grade point average (GPA) as the distal outcome in analyses. Gender, high school GPA, SAT math scores, and university were covariates. Latent profile analyses supported adaptive, maladaptive, and nonperfectionist classes and latent class growth mixture models identified distinctly low, moderate, and high patterns of academic stress over the year. Latent transition analyses indicated that maladaptive perfectionists were likely to experience moderate or high stress (none transitioned to low stress), and adaptive perfectionists were likely to have low or moderate stress (only 4% transitioned to high stress). Women were substantially more likely than male maladaptive perfectionists to experience high stress. Low-stressed adaptive perfectionists followed by moderately stressed maladaptive perfectionists had relatively higher GPAs than other groups. Subgroups of perfectionists who transitioned to the next higher stress level had substantially lower GPAs than other groups. Overall, results were consistent with stress-generation and stress-enhancement hypotheses regarding perfectionists.

Therefore, a paucity of research exists that examines what may differentiate women in certain critical and underrepresented fields of STEM education, such as the physical sciences. The focus of this study is to examine differences among women in chemistry in the physical sciences based on background demographics and motivational factors such as academic achievement and experiences ranging from secondary through postsecondary education. This study examines the following research question: On average, do females who select chemistry as compared to physics doctoral programs differ in their reported personal motivations and background factors prior to entering the field? This question is analyzed using variables in a logistic regression from the Project Crossover Survey data set through a subset of female physical science doctoral students and scientists (n = 1137). Results show that females who have higher secondary and postsecondary grades and positive experiences in postsecondary chemistry as well as negative postsecondary physics experiences are more likely to enter the field of chemistry as opposed to physics. Therefore, success and experiences in entry-level chemistry courses are critical for female entry into the field and should be further examined.

The present study focuses on these kinds of factors and analyzes to which degree family factors, school-related factors, and individual stereotypes may influence a woman's academic self-concept. The following study presents a latent regression model which is based on a survey of 296 women from different German universities, all of whom are part of STEM programs of study that have <30% females. It was investigated to which degree individual stereotypes, support in school, and family support contribute to the self-concept in STEM. Gender stereotypes were negatively related to students' STEM-specific self-concept in the selected sample. This study also reveals negative family-related influences that lower a woman's self-concept. Positive predictors on the other hand included school aspects that are found in the students' favorite subjects at school. The results of the study provide important aspects for STEM education. Even though the students participating in the study presumably had good grades in STEM, stereotypes still corrupted their self-concept. One of the reasons for this might lie in stereotypes that attribute girls' achievements to diligence instead of talent. The results also point out that direct support, particularly by parents, can have a negative impact on female students' self-concept. Activities that are meant to support pupils directly may actually backfire and transport stereotypes instead. This stresses the need for indirect support during socialization, e.g., by providing opportunities for children to have positive experiences or by giving them the chance to meet role models that are enthusiastic about their STEM professions. These kinds of measures have the potential to spur students' interest in STEM subjects-something that in the present study proved to be especially beneficial for women's positive self-concept when studying STEM topics.","2017-05-17","2018-06-25 16:04:01","2018-10-26 20:22:36","","703","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these rich stories, we found that women who persisted had a personal vision that included their profession, and that this personal vision enabled them to overcome the bias, barriers and discrimination in the engineering workplace. To validate this finding on a larger population, we developed a scale to measure one's personal vision conceptualized as the ideal self (Boyatzie and Aluevou, 2006). The measure was tested in a pilot study and then used in a study of 495 women with engineering degrees. The findings validate that the ideal self is comprised of self-efficacy, hope, optimism and core identity. For these women, the ideal self directly impacts work engagement and work engagement directly impacts career commitment to engineering.

It has been discovered, for instance, that men are more active and personally prepared at the community level (in Atlantic Canada coastal communities), and more action is still required in developing countries especially to promote gender equality and empower women. Studies contained in this Special Issue also reveal that tutoring and mentoring by other women can promote further involvement in non-traditional professions, such as professional engineering geology, where women are preferring more traditional (less applied) approaches that may circumscribe their ability to find suitable employment after graduation. Moreover, the hiring policy needs to change in many countries, such as Canada, where there are fewer women at entry-level and senior ranks within geography, especially in physical geography as the scientific part of the discipline. The exclusion of women in traditionally male-dominated spheres needs to be addressed and rectified for the ascent of women to occur in scientific geography and in other geosciences as well as science and engineering at large.","2016-04","2018-06-25 16:04:02","2018-06-25 16:04:02","","398","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To measure program effectiveness, we randomly assigned participants (N = 312) to either a treatment group (N = 208) or a waiting-list control group (N = 104). We collected questionnaire data at three points in time. In comparison to the waiting-list group, the treatment-group participants showed greater levels of desirable short-term and long-term developments. Our findings indicate various advantages for online mentoring for promoting girls' interests in STEM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that math achievement in 12th grade mediated the association between gender and attainment of a STEM career by the early to mid-thirties. However, math achievement was not the only factor distinguishing gender differences in STEM occupations. Even though math achievement explained career differences between men and women, math task value partially explained the gender differences in STEM career attainment that were attributed to math achievement. The identification of potential factors of women's underrepresentation in STEM will enhance our ability to design intervention programs that are optimally tailored to female needs to impact STEM achievement and occupational choices.","2015-02-17","2018-06-25 16:04:02","2018-06-25 16:04:02","","36","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, this paper aims to present a research argument that highlights the importance of self-efficacy as it relates to the creation of a science identity for minority students. The authors, in other words, posit that self-efficacy, particularly as it relates to the cultivation of a science identity remains a critical and under-examined component of the STEM success puzzle for underrepresented students. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework used for this paper is taken from two bodies of literature that are used to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between self-efficacy and science identity - self-efficacy, is grounded in social cognitive theory which posits that achievement is rooted in the bidirectional interaction between behavior, personal factors (e.g. cognitive, affective and biological) and external environment (Bandura, 1986). Findings - Developing an understanding of the science identity development for students of color is essential because it helps construct a connection to the belief that science has value and that the student is capable to engage in the sciences successfully. Originality/value - This analysis widens the scholarly discussion on STEM success for students of color to be inclusive of the critical role that the cultivation of a STEM identity plays in their transition from students at a collegiate level to professionals at a workforce capacity.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:03","2018-06-25 16:04:03","","405-417","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowing the extent to which such changes occur in typical introductory undergraduate courses is important for targeting interventions to increase persistence of underrepresented groups in STEM. We measured social-cognitive-career-theory-relevant variables near the middle and at the end of the 1st semester of a gateway introductory chemistry course and found that women had lower STEM self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and STEM interest than did men, even after controlling for actual course performance. Although there were no detrimental changes across the semester for women or men, men experienced a small but significant increase in their perceived support for pursuing a STEM degree, whereas women did not.","2016-03","2018-06-25 16:04:03","2018-06-25 16:04:03","","233-239","","2","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We were especially interested in gender differences in effects given that women remain significantly underrepresented in several STEM areas. Participants were a large sample of undergraduate students (N=450; 52% women) majoring or intending to major in a STEM field. Science self-efficacy and course grades were the main outcome variables; high school GPA was a covariate. Latent profile analyses based on measures of perfectionism and personality (conscientiousness, neuroticism) supported a three-class model of perfectionism. Perfectionism for men was not substantially associated with self-efficacy or grades. Although perfectionism also was not associated with self-efficacy for women, maladaptively perfectionistic women did perform significantly lower in their STEM-related courses compared with other groups. Results indicated that maladaptively perfectionistic women may be at risk for performance disappointments in STEM courses where women have traditionally been underrepresented. In contrast, adaptively perfectionistic women are strong academic performers in those courses. Intervention efforts aimed at addressing the so-called ""leaky pipeline"" might want to account for perfectionism and its adaptive and maladaptive implications for women pursuing STEM careers.

Middle school students participating in school-to-home hands-on energy monitoring activities are compared to middle school and high school students in a different project taking part in activities such as an after-school robotics program. Both groups are compared and contrasted with a third group of high school students admitted at the eleventh grade to an academy of mathematics and science. All students were assessed using the same science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) dispositions instrument. Findings indicate that the after-school group whose participants self-selected STEM engagement activities, and the self-selected academy of mathematics and science group, each had highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to those of STEM professionals, while a subset of the middle school whole-classroom energy monitoring group that reported high interest in STEM as a career, also possessed highly positive STEM dispositions comparable to the STEM Professionals group. The authors conclude that several different kinds of hands-on STEM engagement activities are likely to foster or maintain positive STEM dispositions at the middle school and high school levels, and that these highly positive levels of dispositions can be viewed as a target toward which projects seeking to interest mainstream secondary students in STEM majors in college and STEM careers, can hope to aspire.

Drawing upon survey data and administrative records, our multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that students' math and science self-efficacy beliefs, as well as transfer-oriented interaction, were significant and positive predictors for their intent to transfer into STEM fields as opposed to having no intent to transfer. In addition, the association between transfer intent and these key motivational and contextual factors was moderated by students' racial/ethnic backgrounds, marital status, and childcare obligations. For example, despite the positive relationship between transfer-oriented interaction and the intention to transfer into STEM fields, Black women were less likely to have intent to transfer into STEM fields than White students until Black students reported a moderate level of transfer-oriented interaction. Conversely, Hispanic students were more likely to report intent to transfer into STEM fields than their White peers, even when Hispanic students reported a relatively low level of engagement in transfer-oriented interaction.

Noting that this group faces challenges due to gender and race, research has not always presented their struggles and successes from both a sociological and psychological view. Socialization theory has yielded a great deal of information despite the socialization process being driven by those in charge of the structure by which a person progresses through the STEM fields. Acculturation theory provides a glimpse of how African American females in these aforementioned fields progress from their perspective. Acculturation framework is of value because it parallels the emotional, cognitive, and behavior patterns students take as they progress through graduate school in order to become colleagues of the very professors that taught them. The framework considers the effects of the person's previous background and experiences, their coping skills and tactics, which are important to the success of African American females. Another common dynamic across the theory of acculturation and the experiences of these women is choice and the freedom to choose their own acculturation patterns.","2014-06-02","2018-06-25 16:04:04","2018-06-25 16:04:04","","8","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased allocation of resources to such programs begs for a critical, prescriptive, evidence-based review that will enable researchers to develop optimal interventions and administrators to maximize investments. We begin by providing a theoretical backdrop for K-12 STEM programs by reviewing current data on under-representation and developmental research describing individual-level social factors undergirding these data. Next, we review prototypical designs of these programs, highlighting specific programs in the literature as examples of program structures and components currently in use. We then evaluate these interventions in terms of overall effectiveness, as a function of how well they address age-, ethnicity-, or gender-specific factors, suggesting improvements in program design based on these critiques. Finally, program evaluation methods are briefly reviewed and discussed in terms of how their empirical soundness can either enable or limit our ability to delineate effective program components.

Overall, large gender differences in career plans were found, with males showing far more interest particularly in engineering, whereas females were more attracted to careers in health and medicine during their high school years. The key factor predicting STEM career interest at the end of high school was interest at the start of high school. There was an additional effect of gender, indicating both a lower retention of STEM career interest among females and a greater difficulty in attracting females to STEM fields during high school. During the high school years, the percentage of males interested in a STEM career remained stable (from 39.5 to 39.7), whereas for females it declined from 15.7 to 12.7. The students' initial specific (disciplinary) career interests were found to influence the stability of their interest in a STEM career, with those interested in physics careers at the start of high school having the highest retention in STEM. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Why are women represented in some science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields more than others? We conduct a critical review of the most commonly cited factors explaining gender disparities in STEM participation and investigate whether these factors explain differential gender participation across STEM fields. Math performance and discrimination influence who enters STEM, but there is little evidence to date that these factors explain why women's underrepresentation is relatively worse in some STEM fields. We introduce a model with three overarching factors to explain the larger gender gaps in participation in computer science, engineering, and physics than in biology, chemistry, and mathematics: (a) masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men, (b) a lack of sufficient early experience with computer science, engineering, and physics, and (c) gender gaps in self-efficacy. Efforts to increase women's participation in computer science, engineering, and physics may benefit from changing masculine cultures and providing students with early experiences that signal equally to both girls and boys that they belong and can succeed in these fields.

Students took unnecessary courses or could not get into courses in a timely manner, resulting in lost time, money, and credit. An accumulation of delays is particularly detrimental to STEM women and men, given the sequential nature of their programming. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

While women tend to dominate CTE enrollments overall, they remain concentrated in historically feminized fields contrary to nontraditional occupations in which less than 25% of workers are females. Drawing on the emerging research on microaggressions and classroom learning environments, this classroom observation research project of more than 80 hours of observations with supplemental student interviews sought to further an understanding of why women are underrepresented in specific CTE fields. The findings of this study indicated two distinct aspects of the classroom environment that helped stew a culture of gender microaggressions: the instructor pedagogy and communication style, and the impact of physical space. Physical structure, instructor pedagogy, and communication create an environment that often emphasizes and perpetuates social norms connecting men and masculinity to CTE and science, technology, engineering, and math education (STEM), which historically have been male-dominated environments. Results from this study extend the research on microaggressions and learning environments and fill a significant gap on gender and CTE.

This is particularly the case when it comes to young women, many of whom simply don't consider engineering to be suitable for women. The reasons for this are well documented but arc undoubtedly worsened by the fact that only 6% of U K Engineers are female. Taking into account previous studies focusing on the issues of gender in engineering, a community based participatory research approach was adopted in which the reasons why teenage girls fail to view engineering as a viable future study or career option were explored. Two 17 year old female high school students were trained as participatory researchers and employed to conduct semi-structured interviews with their peers. A thematic analysis of the data was undertaken whereupon two distinctive themes emerged in relation to how girls' perceive engineering. The first theme reflected girls' lack of knowledge about what engineering is, whilst the second was related to their views of engineering as a potential career. Verbatim quotes are used throughout the paper to give the teenage participants a previously unheard 'voice in the debate about gender and engineering. The paper concludes by arguing that although engineering has much to offer young women in terms of a potential future career, the main issue is that they lack awareness of what engineering is and what engineers do.

Considering the knowledge gap on this often overlooked topic, we draw upon interview and survey data to explore how life experiences influence the intent to transfer among first-year community college women beginning in STEM. Integrating narrative inquiry to do so, this study paints a complex portrait of two female community college students and the multiple roles and experiences they must reconcile, negotiate, and renegotiate as they navigate toward or away from transfer in STEM. The narratives that emerged reveal the complexity of transfer intent, the importance of recognizing the impact of life experiences, and the ways in which to use such experiences as supports—rather than barriers—to enhance the educational pathways for these students.

Survey results in our study and elsewhere show strong gender disparities in anticipated pursuit of Physics after completion of compulsory education. In order to explore the constructions of gender and Physics underlying these trends, we focus on qualitative interview data, applying Foucaultian analysis of discourse to investigate gendered narratives underpinning adolescents' and their parents' articulations. This analysis reveals three key discourses at work on the topic of women's access to Physics: (a) equality of opportunity, (b) continued gender discrimination in and around Physics, and (c) Physics as quintessentially masculine. We additionally identify five distinct narratives supporting the discourse of physics as masculine. These various discourses and narratives are interrogated, and their implications explored. We conclude that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of the Physical sciences as a masculine and 'hard' domain will we increase the presence of women in the sector. Working with young people to analyse and deconstruct the discursive assumptions made in relation to gender and Physics, as well as further work to increase accessibility and broaden representation in Physics, may be fruitful ways to challenge these longstanding associations between Physics and masculinity.

Public two-year colleges provide a foundation for baccalaureate degree attainment, educate a skilled math and science workforce, and support local economic development. Our research, which examines women STEM faculty at community colleges, highlights the role of gender in reproducing advantages and disadvantages within the academy. Methodology – Data were collected by face-to-face interviews with 27 women faculty at nine community colleges in Ohio. We utilized semi-structured interviewing techniques to examine key dimensions such as decision-making leading to employment in two-year institutions, perceived advantages and disadvantages of such work, job satisfaction, and challenges to balancing career and family. Findings - Results indicate considerable satisfaction among women faculty members, hut contradict a popular stereotype that work at com-munity colleges is easier for women with families. Despite relative parity in terms of occupational composition, pay, and tenure, community col-leges are gendered in that they lack formal programs, institutionalized support, and leadership opportunities to support women. Research limitations – Adjunct faculty play an important role in higher education but are underrepresented in our sample. Future research is needed to examine the unique situation of part-time faculty. Implications – Community colleges are uniquely poised to contribute to improving gender equality for women in STEM. Understanding commu-nity colleges and the academic careers of women in STEM employed by these institutions is a vital step in our nation's efforts to develop systemic approaches to increase representation and advancement of women in STEM careers.

Their numerical minority means that women continue to experience this interaction context differently than men. Many still find that they are the only woman in labs, research teams, and study groups (Dryburgh, 1999; McIlwee & Robinson, 1992). If knowing how to conform to the culture of engineering is as adaptive as this ethnographic research suggests, then to the extent that male engineering students support a culture of engineering that is gendered masculine, we predict that over time interactions with them may produce changes in women's gender-role attitudes, perceptions of engineering, and beliefs about women in engineering ""having it all."" Panel B of Table 1 tests our second set of predictions by exploring how women's attitudes differ by cohort by comparing women who are in at least their fourth year of engineering (fourth year) and women who have been in engineering school for less than two months (first year). The one gender-role attitude that differentiates these women is particularly instructive. Fourth-year women express significantly higher levels of agreement with the traditional breadwinner ideology than do their first-year counterparts. Our finding for perceptions of engineering is also consistent with our predictions about the consequences for women participating in a culture of engineering that emphasizes how the life and work patterns of an engineer are modeled on traditional gender roles in the work and family domains. Our results for beliefs about women in engineering ""having it all"" depend on the particular statement considered. There is no difference in levels of agreement with the statement that women may have both a family and engineering career. But when asked about women combining family with a top-level or a rewarding career in engineering, women in fourth year report significantly lower levels of agreement with these two statements. As a group, women enter engineering school with nontraditional attitudes (e.g., 81% of the first-year women either strongly disagreed or disagreed with the stereotype of engineering as masculine compared with 49% of women in fourth year, 62% of men in first year, and 50% of men in fourth year). But in their day-to-day interactions with members of the numerical majority, women continually encounter traditional gender-specific expectations that depart significantly from their own more egalitarian alternatives. They respond by ""doing engineering"" in ways that reproduce the very stereotypes of women and engineering that have been targeted by attempts to increase the participation of women in engineering. This suggests that policies and programs targeting women may get them into engineering. But developing and implementing policies and programs that target men may keep them there by changing the culture of doing engineering that currently excludes many women unless they conform.","","2018-06-25 16:04:08","2018-06-25 16:04:08","","376-379","","4","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agendas in research and innovation policies also need to reflect these issues, and fair allocation of resources within both science and technology needs to be on the agenda. Getting women into high-level positions is not enough. Articulating the full research and innovation agendas for women will require broader participatory processes.

This research interrogates prevailing assumptions about industrial engineering to explore why undergraduate women are drawn to industrial engineering over other engineering majors. Our mixed method approach used three sources of data. Quantitative analyses of a large, longitudinal dataset allowed us to draw empirical generalizations about academic performance, attraction to, and persistence within industrial engineering among men and women. We triangulated this with qualitative focus group data among women majoring in IE. Finally, we used content analysis of university IE Web sites to understand context and discourse. In our dataset, industrial engineering is the only engineering major that gains women and men from the third semester through six-year graduation and among all race-gender combinations (except Black men). Women in focus groups reveal that they are drawn to IE for a myriad of social factors including: warmth, flexibility, a sense it is more feminine, and career opportunities, among others. Content analysis of Web sites reveals that IE emphasizes collegiality and leadership opportunities as intrinsic to me discipline. Using a social capital framework, we showed that the context of IE, including prevailing norms and possibilities for networking, promotes ideologies of success that lead to greater attraction to and persistence within the major.","","2018-06-25 16:04:09","2018-06-25 16:04:09","","288-318","","2","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research extended work primarily conducted in the United States by investigating implicit gender-STEM stereotypes–and their relation to performance–among female and male engineering and humanities students in Southern France. In study 1 (N=55), we tested whether implicit gender-math stereotypes–as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998)–would be weaker among female engineering students as compared to female humanities, male engineering and male humanities students. In study 2 (N=201), we tested whether this same results pattern would be observed with implicit gender-reasoning stereotypes (using a newly created IAT) and, in addition, whether implicit gender-reasoning stereotypes would be more strongly (and negatively) related to math grades for female humanities students as compared to the three other groups. Results showed that female engineering students held weaker implicit gender-math and gender-reasoning stereotypes than female humanities, male engineering and male humanities students. Moreover, implicit stereotyping was more negatively related to math grades for female humanities students than for the three other groups. Together, findings demonstrate that female engineering students hold weaker implicit gender-STEM stereotypes than other groups of students and, in addition, that these stereotypes are not necessarily negatively associated with math performance for all women. Discussion emphasizes how the present research helps refine previous findings and their importance for women's experience in STEM.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","2018-06-25 16:04:09","2018-06-25 16:04:09","","617-629","","11-12","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to identify individual and contextual factors that distinguish women who persist in engineering careers in the US. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative research was conducted based on semi-structured interviews with 31 women engineers, ten of whom had left an engineering career and 21 persisting for on average 21 years. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed. Findings - Women who persisted in engineering careers articulated high levels of self efficacy, described themselves in terms of their identity as an engineer, and were motivated by the challenges and novelty of the profession. Women engineers' ability to adapt enabled them to persist and thrive despite working in a male-dominated culture characterized by difficulties associated with the workplace, including discrimination. Women who opted out of engineering were less likely to recognize options in navigating the workplace and some felt as if they were pushed into engineering. Persistent engineers were less likely to be married and had fewer children. Research limitations/implications - Although appropriate for an inductive study using a grounded theory approach the sample was small and the data was self reported. Practical implications - A model is developed that integrates individual and contextual factors explaining a woman's persistence in an engineering career and has potential to explain persistence in other professions. To retain more women in engineering careers, organizations and managers should provide opportunities to develop identified skills within the professional domain and should provide opportunities for women engineers that provide continuous learning, on-going challenges and novel work. Originality/value - Although numerous studies have addressed the retention of women in academic engineering programs and several recent studies have described why women leave engineering careers, the novelty of this study is that it addresses why women stay.","","2018-06-25 16:04:09","2018-06-25 16:04:09","","139-154","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six women participated in two-hour interviews providing oral histories that revealed some common themes. In Asia, while science and engineering studies are encouraged, especially for girls, the interviewees had little mentoring. Upon coming to the United States they found themselves isolated in their universities as both East Asian and female minorities. The study findings suggest collective mentoring through a department-formed team of senior mentors with public administrative support is a good model for East Asian women. In this approach, assigned mentors would include at least one woman. Mentors would have an understanding of and be able to discuss work/life balance and would work with protégées to help them with goal setting. This research complements findings of other studies describing mentoring teams working with minority faculty and the importance of women mentors in addressing psychosocial issues.

This growth tends to mask at least three other aspects of the demographics of the science and technology workforce. Unfortunately, aggregated data mask the attrition of women at every phase of the educational and career STEM pipeline. Despite grades and other academic attainments equal to or surpassing those of the men who remain in STEM fields, more women than men leave science and engineering. Why do women exit the STEM workforce? The answer is not genetic disposition or lack of interest. For both male and female scientists, marriage and family create demands that can cut short a thriving STEM career. Yet another major source of leakage in the pipeline results from lack of networking and mentoring. Many institutions of higher education are reviewing and reforming their policies and practices in response to the national focus on women's participation in science and shortages in the science and technology workforce resulting from national security measures introduced after September 11, 2001, which have made it difficult for highly skilled non-U.S. workers to get U.S. visas. Attracting women to science and high-tech entrepreneurship and then retaining them will require changing the culture of science to make it more family-friendly and inviting.","","2018-06-25 16:04:10","2018-06-25 16:04:10","","7-10","","3","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated understanding of how multiple predictor variables affect student degree attainment and to ascertain how the variables' impact is regulated by whether students are in STEM or non-STEM majors. Six-year cohort retention/graduation outcomes are predicted for all students in STEM and non-STEM majors, and are adjusted separately for whether students remain in, or shift into or away from, STEM majors. Long-term retention/graduation is predicted significantly by cumulative grade point average, financial need, aid (work-study, loan, and gift), gender, ethnicity, years living on campus, high school rank (HSR), ACT composite, out-of-state residence, and STEM status. For students starting out in non-STEM majors, six-year graduation/retention also is predicted significantly by learning community participation and whether the student switches to a STEM major.

Community colleges offer a great potential for diversifying and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. Many women of color enter higher education through community colleges, but transfer rates are low, and retention rates of transfer students into STEM at universities are lower still. Through interviews conducted with participants in the National Science Foundation-funded Futurebound program, Reyes reveals an atmosphere in which women of color transfer students experience attitudes and treatment signaling that they do not belong because of age, ethnicity, and gender as well as preconceptions that transfer students are not adequately prepared. Reyes proposes that programs and policies to integrate responses to these challenges could improve the transfer rates and retention of women of color into STEM fields.

This study examined the experiences of thirty women (67% first-generation college students, 23% ethnic minority students) pursuing STEM degrees; they were interviewed once while finishing at community college and again one semester later. The results illustrate facilitators at the community college, including inspirational professors, effective transfer advising, academic resources, and flexible work schedules, and barriers resulting from ineffective initial advising. After transferring to a four-year institution, the majority of women persisted in STEM majors despite many barriers, such as negative course experiences, poor advising, and limited finances. Finding a helpful professor or advisor and cotransfer support boosted belongingness and contributed to persistence. Two students switched to non-STEM fields, while two students withdrew from the four-year school completely; these students faced significant financial barriers and did not find a helpful professor or advisor in a STEM field. Finally, four students delayed their transfer, primarily due to financial reasons and family responsibilities.

Of particular interest is what fields students enter upon departing from an initial STEM major, rather than assuming that such movements are a loss to the STEM fields. Factors that impact major field persistence are also examined, as well as how switching majors affects students' time-to-degree. Using a broad definition of STEM, data from nearly 17,000 undergraduate students was analyzed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations.

Although America is still positioned with a disproportionate share of the world's finest universities–particularly research universities–the reputation of the United States as having the most-prepared workforce in terms of STEM is being challenged because of the lack of individuals, specifically women, who are prepared to assume the workforce demand. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, by 2014 the fastest-growing occupations will require significant training in science and mathematics to successfully compete for a job. Consequently, the U.S. needs to ensure that individuals are prepared in the areas of math and science in order to meet the needs of the nation. Community colleges have been acknowledged as having the potential to play a key role in this increase of human capital. Therefore, understanding the experiences of female students will promote educational environments that are conducive to student success in STEM fields.

Analysis of a five percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 2000 Census and the 2001-06 American Community Surveys shows that women and minorities earn more, relative to comparable white men, in STEM than in non-STEM fields. This general pattern persists in analysis of a 1% sample of federal personnel records, which include better measures of work experience and education. Thus, federal efforts to increase the representativeness of the STEM workforce should increase pay equality in the economy by moving women and minorities into traditionally high-paying fields.

Consistent with hypotheses, women, but not men, who viewed images (Study 1) or overheard conversations (Studies 2a-2b) related to romantic goals reported less positive attitudes toward STEM and less preference for majoring in math/science compared to other disciplines. On days when women pursued romantic goals, the more romantic activities they engaged in and the more desirable they felt, but the fewer math activities they engaged in. Furthermore, women's previous day romantic goal strivings predicted feeling more desirable but being less invested in math on the following day (Study 3).","","2018-06-25 16:04:11","2018-06-25 16:04:11","","1259-1273","","9","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses original panel data to examine behavioral and intentional persistence among students who enter an engineering major in college. Surprisingly, family plans do not contribute to women's attrition during college but are negatively associated with men's intentions to pursue an engineering career. Additionally, math self-assessment does not predict behavioral or intentional persistence once students enroll in a STEM major. This study introduces professional role confidence –individuals' confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill the roles, competencies, and identity features of a profession–and argues that women's lack of this confidence, compared to men, reduces their likelihood of remaining in engineering majors and careers.

Yet, it is important for researchers to also be aware of and draw insights from common patterns in the experiences of women across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Here, we review studies on gender disparities across college STEM on measures that have been correlated with retention. These include disparities in academic performance, engagement, self-efficacy, belonging, and identity. We argue that observable factors such as persistence, performance, and engagement can inform researchers about what populations are disadvantaged in a STEM classroom or program, but we need to measure underlying mechanisms to understand how these inequalities arise. We present a framework that helps connect larger sociocultural factors, including stereotypes and gendered socialization, to student affect and observable behaviors in STEM contexts. We highlight four mechanisms that demonstrate how sociocultural factors could impact women in STEM classrooms and majors. We end with a set of recommendations for how we can more holistically evaluate the experiences of women in STEM to help mitigate the underlying inequities instead of applying a quick fix.

While previous research has demonstrated that this gap is largely attributable to a lack of women pursuing physics in college, prior research reveals little in terms of the characteristics and career interests of women who do plan to major in physics or how these traits have evolved over time. To address these gaps, this study utilized nationwide data on first-time, full-time college students to (1) document national trends in plans to major in physics among women entering college, (2) document the career aspirations of women who intend to major in physics, and (3) explore the characteristics of women who intend to major in physics and how this population has evolved across time. This study found that women's interest in physics has been consistently very low in the past four decades. The most popular career aspiration among women who plan to major in physics is research scientist, although this career aspiration is declining in popularity, while increasing numbers of women say that they are undecided in their career choice. Further, this study identifies a distinctive profile of the average female physics student as compared to women in other STEM fields and women across all majors. Women who plan to pursue a physics major tend to be confident in their math abilities, value college as an opportunity to learn, plan to attend graduate school, and desire to make theoretical contributions to science. However, they are less likely than women in other fields to have a social activist orientation. These findings have important implications for scholars, educators, administrators, and policymakers as they seek to recruit more women into the physics field.

This study follows women scientists and engineers from their non-academic to faculty career and analyzes their experiences transgressing the boundaries of STEM knowledge production sites. We used qualitative methods to collect and analyze semi-structured interviews about the experiences of ten female PhDs who successfully on-ramped into faculty positions with the support of a feminist professional community. Our data revealed four phases of on-ramping that characterized the transition to academia for our participants. Attention to gender in on-ramping also highlights concerns that span the personal and the professional in women scientists and engineers' lives. By illuminating cultural and political practices in STEM sites of knowledge production and the effects of feminist interventions on women's experiences of producing knowledge in STEM fields, this study offers a unique perspective that can elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of these sites, especially in regards to gender politics and knowledge production.","","2018-06-25 16:04:13","2018-10-26 20:18:46","","98-115","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>; <p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of this problem of under-representation stems from the population pool: only 33% of science and engineering doctorate holders employed in academia are women. Other issues include well-known problems of women's participation in STEM fields: lack of role models, unconscious biases, discrimination, and unwelcoming climates. This paper examines the primary barriers to women's participation in (1) STEM areas and (2) arenas. Examination of the two suggests that women in STEM fields are particularly susceptible to the barriers and biases facing women who wish to move into leadership positions. The similarity in the barriers in these two areas could lead to an effective double jeopardy for women entering STEM leadership. A distinct lack of research in the area of women's leadership in STEM fields suggests that this is a major problem that is not currently understood and not being addressed.

We recruited 62 undergraduate women STEM majors concurrently enrolled in STEM and Humanities/Liberal Arts (H/LA) courses. We first assessed self-competence (SC) and self-liking (SL), and then every 2 weeks during the academic semester the participants were asked to report their feelings of belonging and interest in both types of courses (resulting in eight entries). For women with low felt SC and high SL, a greater feeling of belonging to their H/LA class throughout the semester was associated with less STEM class interest, above and beyond feelings of belonging in STEM. For all women, fluctuations in STEM class belonging mapped onto their STEM class interest but not their H/LA class interest. Results suggest not only that can women feel pushed out of STEM when they feel a low sense of belonging, but also that for women with specific self-esteem contingencies, competing experiences of belonging in non-STEM can pull interest away from STEM.

Further, existing research has not explored whether MSC is an equally important predictor of STEM pursuit for women and men. This paper uses a national sample of male and female entering college students over the past four decades to address how MSC varies across STEM majors over time, and to assess the changing salience of MSC as a predictor of STEM major selection in five fields: biological sciences, computer science, engineering, math/statistics, and physical sciences. Results reveal a pervasive gender gap in MSC in nearly all fields, but also a great deal of variation in MSC among the STEM fields. In addition, the salience of MSC in predicting STEM major selection has generally become weaker over time for women (but not for men). Ultimately, this suggests that women's lower math confidence has become a less powerful explanation for their underrepresentation in STEM fields.","","2018-06-25 16:04:14","2019-10-23 14:11:40","","813-842","","8","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In-depth interviews were conducted with eight (8) executive-level administrators in predominantly White institutions of higher education. Of the eight administrators interviewed, six held the position of president, and two held the position of assistant or associate vice chancellor. The interview process utilized a phenomenological approach which focused on African American work experiences in predominantly White two- and four-year institutions of higher education in the southeastern region of the United States. These experiences were based on the participants' interpretations and evaluations of their careers in predominantly White institutions. The participants were asked questions pertaining to what experiences led them to work in predominantly White institutions, their current experience in administrative work, and what advice they would give African Americans seeking administrative roles in predominantly White institutions. Findings indicated that career paths of these African American administrators on predominantly White campuses were diverse, but over half of the administrators began their own college careers in historically Black colleges and universities, most of the administrators earned their undergraduate degrees in the liberal arts, and nearly all completed their graduate work in a field within education. Several of the administrators share a common beginning in their administrative careers: their first position in a predominantly White institution was with a federally funded campus program. The administrators' major statement of advice for African-Americans seeking a career in higher education administration in predominantly White institutions focused on the importance of a strong academic background in the general humanities, a strong work ethic, and skills in communications. Several themes emerged from the descriptions of their administrative experience. Clearly, their administrative experiences were structured by race. Race played an important role in nearly every aspect of the processes and steps that marked their administrative career in predominately White institutions. In addition to the theme of race, three additional themes emerged which were interpreted as personal attributes needed by African American administrators to succeed in their career paths: self-assurance, good communications skills, and an understanding of the politics of higher education administration.","1998","2018-06-25 16:04:15","2018-06-25 16:04:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our specific goals in this paper are twofold: (1) to contribute to current theoretical models and research on enabling URM women in academic STEM fields, and (2) to advance broader current discussions concerning how intersectional approaches might be applied to shape institutional transformation. In order to do this, we first explore the historical and context-specific issues that illustrate how the relative lack of progress made by URM women faculty in STEM is at least partially driven by institutional structures that cannot fully address the experiences of persons with multiple subordinated identities. We then employ current literature on intersectionality and organizational change to theorize four ways that intersectional approaches might specifically help shape more successful institutional interventions. By offering some possibilities presented by an intersectional approach to institutional transformation, we suggest helpful starting points for mobilizing intersectionality in the service of structurally supporting the advancement and success of URM women in STEM.

We used thematic analysis of interviews with 59 senior faculty drawn from 20 departments to identify forces that enabled or constrained demographic change over 13 years. The accounts by faculty from departments that most increased the representation of women included references to four enabling forces (open recognition of a serious problem coupled with shame about past circumstances; strong leadership on diversity from one or more department chairs; change-enabling features of the departmental and disciplinary context; and proactivity in pursuing diversity). The accounts by faculty from departments that did not increase diversity at all included reference to three constraining forces (viewing other priorities as more important than diversity; external factors that constrain or limit the possibility of change; and unfavorable features of the departmental context). Departments that increased faculty diversity somewhat expressed some enabling and some constraining forces, and omitted some. We discuss the implications of these findings for successful departmental change, particularly in the context of larger institutional change efforts.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:16","2018-06-25 16:04:16","","23-47","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perceptions of self-efficacy reported by STEM students are also compared to young people in the general population in Western culture. Research questions about significant differences in self-efficacy across populations within major STEM fields are analyzed through surveys distributed to representative (by ethnicity and gender) populations of over 600 students in two phases at both a research and a teaching institution. While young women in the general population report lower levels of self-efficacy than men, these gender differences in self-efficacy almost disappear in STEM disciplines; gender gaps in self-efficacy are significant only in select disciplines (chemistry, computer science, and engineering). In sharp contrast to the similarities between men and women, when viewing ethnicity, African-American and Hispanic students demonstrate a higher level of general self-efficacy compared to their Caucasian and Asian peers, but these differences shrink substantially in the classroom. Among all ethnic groups studied, Asians, regardless of area of instruction or gender, consistently report lower levels of self-efficacy than other major ethnic groups. Differences in self-efficacy among gender and ethnic groups in multiple STEM disciplines at various levels in school, at both a teaching and a research institution, highlight the need to alter the STEM classroom and culture in order to level the playing field among minority and majority students.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:17","2018-06-25 16:04:17","","27-45","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the United States continues to educate scientists and engineers at current levels, there will be a shortage of 1 million STEM workers in the next decade, adversely affecting global competitiveness (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012). In 2010 only 28 percent of the US STEM workforce was female (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics 2013, cited under Statistical Compendia). If more women were to enter STEM, this would not only relieve the shortage of STEM workers, but also provide lucrative jobs to women, and include their perspectives, fostering innovation and scientific progress. Shortages of women in STEM exist in other countries and are being addressed with varying levels of success (see Cross-Cultural Findings). However, the majority of research efforts examining the reasons behind women’s underrepresentation in STEM have been conducted in the United States, often funded by the US government (e.g., by the National Science Foundation’s “Broadening Participation in Computing” and “Research on Gender in Science and Engineering” programs). The Theories researchers employ focus on different kinds of explanations for female underrepresentation in STEM with varying ramifications and implications for interventions. For example, some researchers focus on biological explanations, attributing female underrepresentation in STEM to gender differences in Quantitative, Spatial, and Verbal Abilities. Other researchers focus on psychological factors such as Stereotype Threat, women’s low Self-Efficacy in male-dominated fields, a lack of Sense of Belonging or Identification with a STEM Field, and negative Stereotypes about STEM that conflict with women’s Gender Roles and Values. Furthermore, there exist cultural and institutional barriers that deter women or make it difficult for them to succeed in STEM fields. These include a lack of Role Models, the Role of Parents in encouraging females, Pedagogical Issues, difficulties in the workplace such as a chilly climate, problems with Work-Life Balance that disproportionately affect women who typically are the primary caretakers of children and elderly parents, and outright Bias and Discrimination. Furthermore, it is important to discuss effective intervention strategies. This entry also examines whether women’s underrepresentation in STEM is a cross-cultural phenomenon. Striving for currency, this article will focus almost exclusively on work that has been published within the last ten years. Rather than presenting research on individual STEM disciplines separately, this entry discusses the major issues and causes across the disciplines. This provides for a less repetitive presentation and facilitates comparisons within one topic across disciplines (e.g., under the heading Self-Efficacy the reader can compare research on computer science, technology, and engineering). I also note that certain STEM fields are overrepresented among research on specific causes. For example, most research on Stereotype Threat focuses on math. And certain STEM fields have received more research attention than others. Computer science, science as a general area, and engineering have been well studied. Math has been studied well in K-12 samples, but less well in higher education. Specific science fields like physics, astronomy, chemistry, or the geosciences have received much less attention.","2015-01-15","2018-06-25 16:04:18","2018-06-25 16:04:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","English","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1093/obo/9780199828340-0161","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Retention of women in STEM and in engineering in particular has been a concern historically. In this paper, we investigate whether this gap has increased because a larger proportion of females entering engineering find themselves ill-matched to this field, or whether the gap has decreased as engineering becomes more accommodating to women. Using 1993-2010 nationally representative NSF SESTAT surveys, we compare cohorts of BSEs at the same early-career stages (from 1-2 to 7-8 years post-bachelors). We find no evidence of a time trend in the gender gap in retention in engineering and a slightly decreasing gender gap in leaving the labor force. We find, as others have, that the majority of the gender retention gap is due to women leaving the labor force entirely and that this exit is highly correlated with child-bearing; yet women with engineering majors are half as likely as all college-educated women to leave the labor market. There are no clear time trends in female BSEs leaving the labor market. Single childless women are actually more likely than men to remain in engineering jobs. Some of the gender differences in retention we find are caused by differences in race and engineering subfield. With controls for these, there is no gender retention difference by 7-8 years post-bachelors for those full-time employed. There were two unusual cohorts-women with 1991-1994 BSEs were particularly likely to remain in engineering and women with 1998-2001 BSEs were particularly likely to leave engineering, compared to men. Cohorts before and after these revert toward the mean, indicating no time trend. Also, women who leave engineering are just as likely as men to stay in math-intensive STEM jobs.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:19","2019-10-23 14:01:30","","1144","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 26347671","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Related, students' perceptions during academic difficulty are increasingly studied in educational psychology, suggesting a link between such perceptions and task persistence. Despite interest in examining the gender disparities in STEM, these concepts have not been considered in tandem. In this manuscript, we investigate how perceived ability under challenge-in particular in mathematics domains-influences entry into the most sex-segregated and mathematics-intensive undergraduate degrees: physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science (PEMC). Using nationally representative Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS) data, we estimate the influence of perceived ability under challenging conditions on advanced high school science course taking, selection of an intended STEM major, and specific major type 2 years after high school. Demonstrating the importance of specificity when discussing how gender influences STEM career pathways, the intersecting effects of gender and perceived ability under mathematics challenge were distinct for each scientific major category. Perceived ability under challenge in secondary school varied by gender, and was highly predictive of selecting PEMC and health sciences majors. Notably, women's 12th grade perceptions of their ability under mathematics challenge increased their probability of selecting PEMC majors over and above biology. In addition, gender moderated the effect of growth mindset on students' selection of health science majors. Perceptions of ability under challenge in general and verbal domains also influenced retention in and declaration of certain STEM majors. The implications of these results are discussed, with particular attention to access to advanced scientific coursework in high school and interventions aimed at enhancing young women's perceptions of their ability, in particular in response to the potentially inhibiting influence of stereotype threat on their pathways to scientific degrees.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:19","2018-06-25 16:04:19","","530","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 26113823","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, audit data do not control for applicant quality, allowing some to argue women are hired at higher rates because they are more qualified. To test this, Williams and Ceci (2015) conducted an experiment demonstrating a preference for hiring women over identically-qualified men. While their findings are consistent with audits, they raise the specter that faculty may prefer women over even more-qualified men, a claim made recently. We evaluated this claim in the present study: 158 faculty ranked two men and one woman for a tenure-track-assistant professorship, and 94 faculty ranked two women and one man. In the former condition, the female applicant was slightly weaker than her two male competitors, although still strong; in the other condition the male applicant was slightly weaker than his two female competitors, although still strong. Faculty of both genders and in all fields preferred the more-qualified men over the slightly-less-qualified women, and they also preferred the stronger women over the slightly-less-qualified man. This suggests that preference for women among identically-qualified applicants found in experimental studies and in audits does not extend to women whose credentials are even slightly weaker than male counterparts. Thus these data give no support to the twin claims that weaker males are chosen over stronger females or weaker females are hired over stronger males.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:19","2018-06-25 16:04:19","","1532","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 26539132","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4JWVW5JS","thesis","2013","Mahajan, Agrima","Bridging The Gender Gap: An Empirical Survey Of Provosts, Deans And Department Chairs In Stem Fields","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/1813/34196","The low number of women in the hard sciences has been a long standing concern in universities. Concerns regarding women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in particular have recently come into the limelight in lieu of the fact that women are catching up to (or have exceeded!) men in many other fields, yet the number of women in these fields remains significantly lower than the number of men. Previous research has shown that it is women who want to balance family and research in particular who struggle to deal with the clash between the biological and tenure clocks, and end up choosing one or the other. Our work in this paper is built on the premise that structural changes at the university level will provide these women with policies that enable them to balance both family and work. Many other researchers in this field have suggested policies that could be implemented to help women. The aim of our research was to get university administrators to evaluate these policies to see which ones are actually good policies that can be implemented to help women succeed at both work and family life. To do this, we surveyed university administrators on their attitudes towards policies that could help women succeed in STEM fields. Using previous research, we compiled a list of policies that have been suggested to help women succeed in the sciences. This list was sent out by email to a total of 1529 provosts, deans, associate deans and department chairs of STEM fields in 96 research-oriented universities. These university administrators were asked for 2 responses to each policy - a rating of its quality and a rating of its feasibility. Our survey received 474 replies, of which 334 contained data which was used in the analysis. For the analysis done in this paper, publicly available information was gathered on each respondent's gender, title, and university type (public or private). After de-identifying the data to protect the confidentiality of the respondents, the data was analyzed to look for differences in the responses based on gender, title and university type. The analysis found that the evaluation of quality and feasibility of some policies depended heavily on the gender of the respondents, while the title of the respondent did not significantly affect most quality or feasibility ratings. University type was significant for policies that involved funding and the preferential hiring of women. However, when it came to the best overall policies, none of these factors were particularly significant. Thus we conclude that the best policies are considered to have high quality and feasibility regardless of gender, title or university type of the respondent. These best policies include providing equal opportunities for women and men to lead committees and research groups, developing mentoring programs to reduce isolation of female faculty, and providing on-campus childcare centers. This conclusion makes it easy for administrators who read this report to consider implementing these best policies without being overly concerned about how the gender, title or university type of the respondents influenced the results. The hope is that administrators across all research-oriented universities will use this report as a basis for implementing or altering policies to help women in STEM-fields better balance their work and family lives. Having the assurance that these best policies are backed up by the opinions of other administrators in similar positions will hopefully give administrators the reassurance necessary to implement new policies and bridge the STEM fields' gender gap. ii 2018-08-20","2013-08-19","2018-06-25 16:04:20","2018-06-25 16:04:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous studies have addressed the problem of the underrepresentation of women in information technology programs, but few studies have focused on undergraduate women who persist in, rather than drop out of, information technology programs. Furthermore, differential classroom interactions have constituted the primary explanatory variables, rather than inadequate advising and mentoring. This exploratory study addresses the gaps in the literature by focusing on how the advising and mentoring experiences of undergraduate students in two information technology programs at a large public research university might influence, positively or negatively, their construction of academic identities as computer scientists or technology experts, and ultimately their educational choices (i.e., persistence or attrition). The Technology, Arts, and Media (TAM) certificate program is a multidisciplinary program enrolling approximately two-thirds women, and thus represents a nontraditional program. The Computer Science program is a narrowly focused program enrolling approximately 85% men, and thus represents a traditional program. The researcher used three measurement tools to collect data: (1) Documentary evidence related to the two programs, (2) Primary and secondary observations of ten courses in the two programs, and (3) Forty-one student and advisor (thirty-one student and ten advisor) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the data revealed that advising and mentoring were rarely cited as factors directly related to the underrepresentation of women in information technology programs. Nonetheless, three themes emerged. First, advising experiences might indirectly and in very limited ways influence the construction of academic identity among women. However this influence becomes apparent primarily in terms of the absence of, rather than presence of, advising experiences that encourage and support the development of women as legitimate computer scientists or technology experts. Second, mentoring relationships, which were not common, were not highly valued by most students in my sample. Third, learning environments supportive for the students in my sample were more evident in the nontraditional TAM program than in the traditional Computer Science program.","2002","2018-06-25 16:04:20","2018-06-25 16:04:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The National Longitudinal Study of High School Seniors of 1972 (1972–1979) and the National Education Longitudinal Study 1988 (1992–2000) are used to test Jacobs' argument that young women's success in science majors is hampered by a life-long process of social control. Gender socialization teaches boys and girls to expect different rewards and responsibilities from work and family. Consequently, as young women and men make decisions about their educational and career pursuits, they do so in gender-specific ways (Jacobs 1989; 1995; 2003). I test Jacobs' social control hypothesis by examining changes in how adolescents' early valuation of family affects young women's and men's intentions to pursue science and achievement of a science degree in the 1970s and 1990s. In the 1970s, family commitment operated in a gender-specific way, hampering only young women's science intentions and achievements, but not significantly affecting men's. By the 1990s, both young men's and women's science intentions are dampened by their commitment to family. However, young women's science achievements continue to be hindered by their valuation of family, while men's science success is not similarly affected. My findings indicate some convergence in the effect of family commitment on young women's and men's plans to major in science, but also suggest the resilience of gender in shaping young adults' science achievements. The second part of this dissertation uses the NELS to examine social-psychological mechanisms that reproduce contemporary gender segregation of college majors. Competing explanations of gender segregation in academic majors are examined: the perceived competency (Correll) and social control (Jacobs) hypotheses. Specifically, I assess the influence of math efficacy and valuation of family on adolescents' intended college majors and their earned degrees. Majors are categorized as: traditionally female majors, non-physical sciences, social sciences, business, and physical science/engineering. My results suggest that math-efficacy promotes adolescents' science intentions and achievements, but does not explain the gender segregation of majors. Instead, early orientations toward family are essential to understanding contemporary gender segregation of academic majors.","2006","2018-06-25 16:04:20","2018-06-25 16:04:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My research problem emerges from earlier feminist research addressing the low numbers of women in university Computer Science programs, particularly at the graduate level. After over twenty years of active feminist representation of this problem, mostly through large survey-based studies, there has been little change. I argue that rather than continuing to focus on the rising and falling numbers of women studying Computer Science, it is critical to analyze the specific socio-economic and socio-cultural conditions which produce gendered and racialized exclusion in the field. Informed by Institutional Ethnography—a method of inquiry developed by Dorothy Smith—and by Foucault’s work on governmentality, I examine how specific institutional processes shape the everyday lives of women students. Through on-site observation and interviews with women in graduate Computer Science studies, Computer Science professors and university administrators, I investigate how the participants’ everyday institutional work is coordinated through external textual practices such as evaluation, reporting and accounting. I argue that the university’s institutional practices produce ‘women in computing’ as a ‘problem’ group in ways that re-inscribe women’s outsider status in the field. At the same time, I show that professionalized feminist educational projects may contradict their progressive and inclusive intentions, contributing to the ‘institutional capture’ (Smith) of women as an administrative ‘problem’. Through ethnographic research that follows women students through a range of experiences, I demonstrate how they variously endorse, subvert and exploit the contradictory subject positions produced for them. I illustrate how a North American-based institutional feminist representation of ‘women in computing’ ignores the everyday experiences of ethnoculturally diverse female student participants in graduate Computer Science studies. I argue that rather than accepting the organization of universal characteristics which reproduce conditions of exclusion, North American feminist scholars need to consider the specificity of social relations and forms of knowledge transnationally. Finally, I revisit how women in the study engage with ‘women in computing’ discourse through their lived experiences. I suggest the need for ongoing analysis of the gender effects and changing socio-cultural conditions of new technologies.","2009","2018-06-25 16:04:21","2018-06-25 16:04:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While much of the research on women's experience in science has focused on their entry into or exit out of STEM fields (the ""leaky pipeline""), less is known about the obstacles that women scientists face at work, due to the dearth of ethnographic work exploring gender and day-to-day experiences in the academic workplace. Using data from a qualitative study of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in chemistry involving over 120 hours of ethnographic observation and 40 semi-structured interviews, I focus specifically on the gendered nature of authority, expertise, and impression management to investigate several of the obstacles women scientists face at work. In the first chapter, I investigate men and women graduate students' and postdocs' expectations of expertise. I argue that overall, men are more likely than their women peers to be seen as experts in chemistry. As a result, men graduate students benefit from more practice with skills that are applicable to their future careers: applying scientific knowledge to relevant questions and communicating this information to others. In the second chapter, I focus on gender and graduate student socialization. I find that the link between men, science, and academia creates a context in which men do not need to work as hard to establish their claim to scientific authority. Therefore, men are able to perform masculinity in varied and complex ways, while women, who do not embody masculinity, feel more pressure to conform to strict norms of competition that are associated with traditional masculinity. In the last chapter, I discuss the impression management strategies that men and women chemists-in-training use to navigate authority and expertise. I find that men are more likely than women to employ interactional styles that feature their expertise when in group situations, while women are more likely to minimize theirs. In contrast, while teaching, women sometimes use styles that align with masculinity rather than with femininity. Finally, men's bodies occasionally eliminate men's need for impression management in the classroom because being masculine grants them authority.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:21","2018-06-25 16:04:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attempts to identify the source of the gender gap have indicated that causes range from interactional (Bergvall & Remlinger 1996) to institutional (Moss-Racusin 2012). Some research has suggested that the perception of STEM fields as ""unfeminine"" reduces young girls' interest in them. This idea positions expert STEM identities as at odds and incompatible with feminine identities (Thomas-Hunt & Philips 2004). Using data from a large ethnographic study on the cultural and linguistic practices of high-achieving math and science undergraduates at a public university in Southern California, this thesis argues that mathematical expertise can indeed be enacted along with a range of feminine personae. Focusing on three female students who regularly show expertise in their small peer groups in a multivariable calculus course, I argue that each woman enacts expertise while performing different gendered styles. One student claims a more traditional nerd girl identity, eschewing slang and traditional forms of feminine material self-presentation and using a formal mathematical register and unmarked intonation. The second student, while often forceful that she is right, employs a marked nasal whiny intonation when contesting the teaching assistant's decisions and advice, constructing a kind of childlike cute femininity. The third student enacts expertise within her otherwise all-male peer group, and physically presents herself as more emblematic of youthful, middle-class femininity while employin non-interrogative rising intonation, a practice often ideologically seen as feminine. This study shows that a range of feminine styles is not incompatible with expert STEM identities. This research implies that for STEM educators concerned with gender equity, by recognizing that expertise can be accompanied by any kind of gendered persona, women should be encouraged to explore career paths in STEM fields without feeling that they need to conform to a certain type of feminine style.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:21","2018-06-25 16:04:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A core of questions concerning childhood, family, school, peers, gender/ethnicity issues, identity as a scientist/engineer, and future expectations revealed complex social dynamics underlying the development of non-traditional career identities. Ten women who majored in chemistry, physics, and engineering were interviewed. Four were of ethnicities (Polynesian and Filipino that are severely under-represented in science and engineering. Four were East Asian, two were white. Narrative analysis was guided by post-modern, post-colonial, and feminist theoretical perspectives. Each woman had a unique set of experiences she thought important to shaping her identity. However, cross case analyses hint at commonalties based on ethnicity and culture. Due to their historical location in post-colonial Hawaii, Polynesian and Filipino women were more likely to encounter negative race and class stereotypes. East Asian women were more likely to experience gender discrimination within the family. Most life stories were marked by contradictions, anger, and frustration centering on issues of race, class, gender, and power. Women responded with strategies of opposition, mimicry, accommodation, denial, and avoidance. The results indicate that schools and families are sites in which self/other identity is powerfully constructed. Women who described themselves with traits historically associated with males, i.e., as unafraid, independent, competent, and physically fit, expressed higher expectations of career success. This underscores the importance of activities that counter class, ethnic, and gender stereotypes. Post secondary instructors need to be aware of the patriarchal ideology of science and the ways it is materialized in practices that exclude women. Educators at all levels must consider the impact their practices have on the way that students construct self/other identities of class, race, gender, and ability that impact on future career choices.","1995","2018-06-25 16:04:21","2018-06-25 16:04:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do constructions of scientific identities engage with racial and gendered constructions of the body? What work is involved in the occupation of multiple social sites, such as for women of color in physics? This work addresses these questions through a six-year, longitudinal qualitative project originally including over four hundred students and focusing on ten successful female minority physics majors at a large, diverse, top-tier public research institution. The study develops a theory of embodied social practice that examines the co-constructions of cultures, agency, and identities in the process of becoming a physicist. In particular, the experiences of multiply marginalized members, women of color physics majors, are used as a lens to see invisible but contingent factors for membership in the local physics culture. Key gatekeeping mechanisms regulating this membership are identified; also described are individual and institutional responses that enable young, traditional outsiders to continue to succeed on school and career trajectories in physics. First, women of color come to understand that the notion of competence is readily granted to men (and, to a much lesser degree, to nonminority women) but denied to them. In response, they learn to maneuver their bodies and voices as strategically pliable tools to perform belonging and scientific knowledge by either complying with or disrupting locally acceptable norms of ethnicity and heterosexual maleness and femaleness. Next, women of color often face disempowerment due to their invisibility imposed by peers and faculty. However, they are not passive recipients; they often manipulate their in/visibility for purposes of accessing and maintaining physics membership. Finally, they persist in the field by accruing cultural and social capital in innovative ways for themselves, each other, and future generations of women and minority scientists. Their activities and growing presence in the field are helping to transform the demographics and practices of physics into a more diverse and inclusive culture. The conclusions discuss these issues in the current context of unversities' search for positive models of outreach and retention and the ongoing political backlash against minorities.","2002","2018-06-25 16:04:21","2018-06-25 16:04:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholarship on this disparity has, in the past, focused on issues of equity and difference in order to find ways to recruit and retain more women in physics. This approach offered a limited perspective on gender and relied on essentialist notions of being a man, woman or physicist. This study highlights the importance of a focus on gender as an aspect of identity construction, thus opening up possibilities for exploring how doctoral students navigate ideologies of gender at the same time that they learn how to become physicists. Doctoral physics students have stories about what kinds of actions, behaviours and ways of doing physics allow individuals to be recognized as physicists. Viewing a physics department as a case study, and individual participants as embedded cases, this study uses a sociocultural approach to examine the ways doctoral students construct these stories about becoming physicists. Through observations, photo-elicitation, and life history interviews, eleven men and women shared stories about their experiences with physics, and the contexts that have enabled or constrained their trajectories into doctoral physics. The results of this study revealed the salience of recognition in the constitution of physicist identities: individuals who saw themselves, or were seen by others, as physicists were more likely to pursue trajectories into academic physics. Further, various interchangeable forms of competence emerged as assets that can be used to achieve recognition in this physics community: technical, analytical, and academic competence were identified by participants as characteristics necessary to achieve recognition as a physicist. Additionally, achieving recognition as a competent physicist often involved a complex negotiation of gender roles and the practice of physics. The results demonstrated that a persistent tension exists between participants' conventional and gendered descriptions of doing physics and being physicists, and the actual business of doing physics and being physicists. The study offers new perspectives on the interaction between gender and physics, and challenges current thinking about the reason for gender inequality in science and the best methods for rectifying that inequality. The dissertation ends with recommendations for further research and suggestions for the undergraduate and graduate physics curriculum.","2010","2018-06-25 16:04:22","2018-06-25 16:04:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major research question guiding this study was: How do African-American women perceive the climate and interactions with peers and faculty in undergraduate STEM classrooms? Using qualitative methods and a multiple case study design, a sample of 11 women were interviewed. This study was also informed by data from 31 African-American women who participated in focus group interviews at annual meetings of the National Society of Black and Hispanic Physicists. Findings indicated that the women excelled in small courses with faculty who took a personal interest in their success. They also perceived that there was a pervasive culture in physics and other STEM departments that often conflicted with their own worldviews. Findings also indicated that the women's perceptions of classroom experiences varied widely depending on professors' behaviors, institution types, and the level of courses. It is anticipated that through a better understanding of their perceptions of STEM learning environments and factors in their persistence, STEM faculty and departments can better retain and support this population of students.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:22","2018-06-25 16:04:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though physics education reform efforts supporting interactive engagement have doubled students’ learning gains (Hake, 1998), gender and race gaps persist (Brewe et al., 2010; Kost, Pollock, & Finkelstein, 2009). When students’ subjectivities align with presentations of physics, they are more likely to develop positive physics identities (Hughes, 2001). However, both traditional and reformed physics classrooms may present physics singularly as abstract, elite, and rational (Carlone, 2004). Drawing from feminist science, I argue that binaries including abstract / concrete, elite / accessible, and rational / emotional are hierarchal and gendered, raced and classed. The words on the left define conventional physics and are associated with middle class white masculinity, while the words on the right are associated with femininity or other, and are often missing or delegitimized in physics education, as are females and minorities. To conceptualize a feminist physics education, I deconstructed these binaries by including the words on the right as part of doing physics. I do not imply that women and men think differently, but that broadening notions of physics may allow a wider range of students to connect with the discipline. I used this conceptual framework to modify a popular reformed physics curriculum called Modeling Instruction (Hestenes, 1987). I taught this curriculum at an urban public college in an introductory physics course for non-science majors. Twenty-three students of diverse gender, race, ethnic, immigrant and class backgrounds enrolled. I conducted an ethnography of the classroom to learn how students negotiate their subjectivities to affiliate with or alienate from their perceptions of physics, and to understand how classroom experiences exacerbate or ameliorate differences in achievement, participation and feelings towards physics. Findings show how students (dis)connect with physics in both stereotypical and atypical ways; for example, one student drew from a classed identity to reject physics (e.g. “working was always in my DNA, but school is never really for me”) and another student related his classed and gendered work as a mechanic to learn physics. Traditional aspects of the physics curriculum privileged discourse, performances, and epistemology associated with middle class white masculinity. The statement “I might nit pick it because I did it my way” is characteristic of competitive, assertive, self-interested discourse during problem presentations, taken up by male and female students. However, students engaged in other ways of doing physics that were personal, emotional, caring, inclusive and collaborative. A male student wrote, “Everyone is engaging and I feel that this class is like a family.” Some students developed positive physics identities as they redefined physics: “When I experience physics on my own in anytime in a day or week, I feel like a physics person.” Implications include interrogating beliefs about physics and students, and examining one’s own practices such that the “smog of bias” (Kost-Smith, Pollock, & Finkelstein, 2010) may be demystified.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:22","2018-06-25 16:04:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study also sought to understand how Latina scientists and engineers achieved high-level positions within their organizations and the impediments they encountered along their professional journey. The theoretical framework for this study sought a transcendental phenomenological view with an interpretive perspective that is an interpretive paradigm. Utilizing a phenomenological approach, rich descriptive data were collected to obtain a better understanding of how the study participants achieved successful careers and whether mentoring was a contributing factor. Eight Latinas scientists and engineers were obtained using a purposeful participant selection method. In-depth interviews, coding, analysis, and careful interpretation resulted in eight major themes. These particular themes revealed common traits and characteristics that these participants shared that made them successful: (a) Trailblazer; (b) Passion and Belief; (c) Support and Encouragement; (d) Networking; (e) Goal-Oriented; (f) Mentoring Type (Grooming, Networking, and E-mentoring); (g) Criticality of Mentoring; and (h) Luck and Opportunities. These eight themes contributed to the participants' professional development and success. The results revealed that (a) it is important to have multiple mentors at all levels; (b) various types of mentoring can be equally effective; (c) mentoring can be critical to an individual's success; (d) the support and encouragement of mentors is essential, both personally and professionally; and (e) mentoring relationships should not be forced, that they should be a mutual agreement in which both the mentor and the mentee willingly and enthusiastically participate. The findings suggest that implementing mentoring programs would have positive implications on the Latina population and that this may encourage them to pursue careers in science and engineering. Recommendations for this study focused on establishing and formalizing mentoring programs, attracting more Latinas to careers in science and engineering, and the need for further research. This study has implications for the future development of mentoring programs for Latinas in science and engineering.","2010","2018-06-25 16:04:22","2018-06-25 16:04:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing America for a Brighter Future (2005) warns that in the long run, the United States might not have enough scientists and engineers to meet its national goals unless the number of domestic students from all demographic groups, including women and students from all ethnic groups are represented. This qualitative study explores the factors that have been beneficial for women's success in engineering careers through a lens of engineering identity exemplified by a culturally diverse sample of professional women in science. Feminist Theory, Critical Feminist Theory and Social Identity Theory serve as the frameworks for this study. The relationships among such factors as self-efficacy, self-esteem, identity and education and success are also examined. The specific type of qualitative research utilized was narrative inquiry. The nine women STEM professionals work for the research division of a large corporation. Each was interviewed individually four times for ninety minutes following three interview protocols. The results were coded and analyzed for common themes. The participants described both making real contributions to society and attaining technical expertise as key benchmarks of their professional success. They also described the female engineer as a problem-solver and independent thinker who helps to improve the quality of life for all the earth's inhabitants. The female engineering identity included being disciplined, persistent and collaborative. Obstacles to women's success and gender issues and identities of minorities were also studied and described. Self-efficacy did have a strong relationship to success as did self-perception and the constructed engineering identity. The findings of the study could be used in attracting, nurturing, and retaining more young women in the STEM professions. With more women actively engaged in the STEM professions, a new definition of engineering has emerged. Engineering has become a more feminine and nurturing science capable of transforming the quality of life for all the citizens of the planet earth.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:22","2018-06-25 16:04:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project was designed to give girls who were interested in science the chance to communicate online with women who were successful STEM professionals. The community provided the girls a venue to ask the women questions about their careers, their interests, and their science identities. Through this venue the girls were able to explore various STEM careers, be exposed to role models, and potentially increase their interest in science for the future. Mentoring has been shown to have a positive impact on girls and help improve their attitudes toward science and interests in STEM. The project examined the nature of the online mentoring process as well as the participants’ perceptions of the opportunities and constraints of the community. The girls were members of an afterschool academy and the mentoring took place through the Internet using a secure educational social networking program. The program spanned a four-week period between April and May 2013. The main purpose of this study was formative since online mentoring is a relatively new area of research. This investigation produced detailed accounts of activities between the girls and the mentors. Findings revealed that the participants approached the community uniquely and explored many aspects of career exploration, STEM interest, and science identity. The participants also identified what they perceived as the opportunities afforded by the community as well as the constraints posed by the community. The research represented by this study was practitioner research with the work connecting theory with practice. The knowledge gained through the intentional reflection on and study of the Einstein Girls online mentoring community was useful in the production of knowledge that is transformative for the researcher’s professional practice and transferable to other settings. The results of this study are most applicable to online mentoring programs with similar contexts and demographics, but are also applicable to other online mentoring communities. Findings from this study have direct implications in the design and operation of future online mentoring programs.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At its core, this study investigates the paths of over three dozen newcomer immigrant English language learner students in high-poverty urban neighborhoods who are not generally considered “legitimate contenders” for Bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields on the basis of such characteristics as test scores, high school and prior preparation, and age. The students are followed through their high school experiences, their transition to college, and through their current progress in college, with explicit attention paid to key mediating experiences and relationships in and especially outside of the classroom that were associated with their toward persistence and success. Thick description and analysis of the students and their experiences, among those who persisted as well as the minority who switched out of STEM majors, helps to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of these students’ ability to succeed while painting a comprehensive picture of their march forward to degrees in STEM fields against a backdrop of economic, linguistic, and other barriers to entry and success. Using a framework of social and capital and resilience theories, this work has uncovered a number of themes and factors that will help educators to better understand the evolution of these traditionally marginalized students' STEM-related interests, skills, and career plans. The findings center around students’ exposure to research internships and other STEM enrichment and outreach experiences, long-term mentoring and other key relationships, and integration of STEM and college access efforts in setting them up for a successful transition to college, as well as an emphasis on the importance of students’ calling upon their own resilience and other strengths and prior experiences. The results provide novel insights and recommendations for improving access and persistence in STEM among students in areas of concentrated poverty who are also struggling with mastering a new language and a host of other challenges.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their retention is essential in order to maintain diversity among faculty. Understanding the complex factors affecting faculty career satisfaction and, ultimately, their retention at a particular institution and in higher education is needed to guide policies and practices as academic institutions strive to retain highly qualified professors and maintain diversity at all ranks. This study explored salient factors related to faculty career satisfaction in STEM disciplines. Data from 2000 STEM faculty at research and doctoral-granting universities were analyzed using path analysis. The results indicated that the factors with the greatest effects on career satisfaction were salary satisfaction (not actual salary) and workload satisfaction. Overall satisfaction with various aspects of one’s nature of work and job equity led to greater overall career satisfaction. Women were less likely than men to be satisfied with the workload or to agree that women are treated fairly, and parents were less likely than non-parents to be satisfied with their workload or with their salary. Additionally, faculty who took more flexible career paths (i.e., allowing for later entry into academe or interruptions for family caretaking) were indirectly more satisfied with their careers than faculty who followed a traditional career trajectory. The implications from these results support the notion that for women, especially women with children, who struggle to balance work and family, the ability to pursue a flexible career path leads to greater career satisfaction, and ultimately greater retention of women faculty in higher ranks.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using Chickering & Gamson's (1987) ""Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education"" as a framework, students' classroom experiences were separated into eight broad categories: Student Preparation, Feedback to Students, Instructor's Expectations of Students, Active Learning, Student Interaction, Instructor's Response to Differences Among Students, Student-Faculty Contact, and Learning Experiences. A survey instrument that included questions related to the eight broad classroom experience dimensions was used to collect data on students' classroom experiences and values in 22 undergraduate biology, chemistry, and mechanical engineering classrooms in a total of three institutions. Most of the classes were sophomore/junior level, and the number of students in each of the classes varied. 896 surveys met the study criteria and were included in the analyses. A total of 23 indices were created using the data collected in the study. Although there were no significant differences in how men and women perceived instructors' classroom behaviors, there were differences in the extent to which men and women reported that they valued particular classroom experiences. For each of these differences (importance of preparation, importance of requirements, importance of cooperative environment, importance of diversity flexibility, and importance of familiarity and respect), women valued the experience more highly than did men. There were also differences in classroom experiences and in the extent to which students valued their experiences across the three disciplines, with more disciplinary differences in students' classroom experiences than in the value they attached to their experiences. While some of the variables included in the study, such as size of class, encouragement from teachers, and expected grade, accounted for a portion of the reported differences in students' experiences and the importance they attached to their experiences, gender and discipline did not add much to the overall understanding of differences in experiences and values.","1997","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study argues that to understand the low participation rates of women compared to men in science and engineering over time requires an understanding of the pipeline through which scientific personnel flow and how women fare in this pipeline. This study asks how the process of moving from high school through college for women and men systematically reduce the relative proportion of women into science and engineering occupations. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and the High School and Beyond . The analysis model incorporates ten sets of variables: background characteristics, precollege characteristics, precollege achievement, intended major, expected benefits and net cost of college attendance, college choice, college achievement, major choice, degree completion, and occupational choice. This study uses an eight-stage recursive model and a combination of regression methods to estimate the outcomes: linear regression by ordinary least squares estimation for continuous outcomes, logistic regression and multinomial logit regression by maximum likelihood estimation for discrete outcomes. Results show that most of the gender-related problems in the participation of science and engineering majors and careers are in fields that require more mathematical competence such as physical sciences, math, and engineering. One issue that arises is why a relatively lower proportion of women than men choose to enter these science fields across time. Gender differences in precollege achievement, gendered socialization or preferences, early career choices, and college choice contribute to explaining the gender gap. A second issue is why the gender effects in choice to enter these science fields weaken across time. Results show a more favorable evaluation by women to enter these science fields across time, a decline in gender differences in SAT math scores to enter these fields, and a decline in the negative institutional effects on women entering these fields. This study suggests multiple policy approaches to address the issues that affect science and engineering career choices at various points in time and located at various institutions.","2001","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project is based on 86 interviews (69 with women engineering students, 12 with engineering professors and administrators, and 5 with other members of the engineering educational community) and some participant observation. Three types of engineering schools were included in this study: a large, public, research university, a small, private, engineering college, and a private, women-only, liberal arts college. The major finding of this study is that women engineering students do not like to be singled out by gender, “spotlighted,” even by programs aimed to help them. This study suggests altering women-in-engineering programs by offering their content to all students and shifting their focus to pre-empting unprofessional behavior. It also suggests that change toward equity in the larger society is an important factor in creating gender equality in engineering education, as these realms are co-created. Finally, this study hypothesizes that, based on the persistence of students' lack of recognition of gender bias in their environments, there may be little bias in the engineering educational environment, perhaps even less than in the larger society.","2003","2018-06-25 16:04:23","2018-06-25 16:04:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2X9XFLB8","thesis","2008","Lambert, Amber D.","Women in engineering: The gendered effects of program changes, faculty activities, and student experiences on learning","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/304495119?accountid=14692","Creating gender equity in engineering education is important for more reasons than simply being a matter of social justice or diversifying the engineering field. It is also a significant educational and public policy issue that will affect the future economic competitiveness of the United States in the global marketplace. Engineering is arguably the leading national example of a profession in which women are under-represented. Undergraduate engineering programs not only need to attract and retain female students, but they must also provide full access to the educational experiences women must have to develop the engineering skills to succeed in the engineering profession. This study explored whether the shift to the “soft” or less technical skills in engineering encouraged by new accreditation standards could potentially have had differential effects for women in engineering from their male counterparts. In particular, this study examined the proposition that program practices and policies, faculty members’ activities, and the experiences of engineering students in college, affect the learning of female students differently than that of male students. The three engineering skills chosen for this study were students’ development of design skills, group skills, and awareness of societal and global issues. Data for this study came from a nationally representative sample of engineering program graduates who received their degrees in 1994 (n = 5,335) and 2004 (n = 4,158), 1,243 faculty, and 147 program chairs at 39 different institutions. This study relied on secondary analysis of data from the Engineering Change study, which assessed changes in student learning associated with the implementation of the new Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000) accreditation standards. The findings from the current study shed light on the complexity of the processes at work in female and male students’ learning and the importance of creating models that can guide research on both male and female students’ development and change while in college. Changes in program and faculty activities affected both students’ experiences and their learning, and those effects differed by gender. This study also revealed that students’ in- and out-of-class experiences differed significantly in their influence on female and male students’ development of selected engineering abilities. For learning that occurs in engineering programs, and perhaps many other professional and academic fields, gender seems to moderate the effects of programmatic and faculty activities, as well as the influences of students’ undergraduate experiences. It is important for faculty and administrators to understand the differences in learning by women and men in order to identify the best ways to produce female graduates with the skills needed in the workplace (Baxter Magolda, 1992). More needs to be done in engineering education than just helping women to adapt to a traditionally masculine field (Salminen-Karlsson, 2002). Responding to individual students’ needs at each level of learning can strengthen the overall educational experience in and outside of the classroom (Baxter Magolda, 1992). After identifying gender patterns in development and learning, the significant differences reveal that males and females may need different challenges and support systems to ensure their future skill levels. In particular, faculty members can stress applied skills to positively affect female students’ abilities to problem-solve and design solutions, and also use active learning pedagogies in their classes to encourage female students to develop their group skills. In addition, out-of-class experiences seem to be more influential on female students’ development of all three learning outcomes than male students’ development of those same skills. Thus, engineering programs and faculty members could encourage to get involved in activities outside of the classroom, such as studying abroad and involvement in professional society chapters. Conversations about national policies shaping student learning in higher education are likely to suffer when researchers and policy makers discount comprehensive research designs and ignore the role of gender in student learning. National policy probably should not overlook differences in the pathways to learning for male and female students. The desire to find the silver bullet that will enhance learning for all students narrows, rather than enriches, actions and policies. If academic and policy decision-making ignores gender differences in students’ experiences and learning outcomes, a true transformation of male-dominated fields will never occur and women’s experiences and levels of learning will not reach their ultimate potential.","2008","2018-06-25 16:04:24","2018-06-25 16:04:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much research has examined how segregation is reproduced by discrimination and coercion, but as such actions become increasingly culturally illegitimate, we must begin to ask why gender inequality persists in the face of its illegitimacy. This project examines how two culturally-informed, individually-held sets of beliefs, gender schemas (beliefs about the appropriate roles and ""essential natures"" of men and women) and self-conceptions (gendered beliefs about the self) inspire decision-making that reproduces occupational gender segregation. Using 5-year longitudinal panel data of students from four institutions (MIT, Olin, Smith and UMass), I study how gender schemas and self-conceptions influence students' major selection and their career decisions 18 months after graduation. This project theorizes a phenomenon I call ""the self-expressive edge of sex segregation,"" the reproduction of occupational sex segregation through the individualistic, self-reflective, yet culturally-informed decisions of social actors. This dissertation shows, first of all, that gender schemas and self-conceptions are indeed co-constructed: our most individualistic beliefs—who we think we are as people—are informed by our adherence to cultural beliefs about gender. These culturally-informed self-conceptions not only help direct the distribution of men and women into already-segregated college majors and career fields, they help to reproduce the cultural sex-typing of such fields as ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" domains. As I show with a case study of engineering students, these individual-level beliefs can also interact with professional cultures in such a way that segregation is reproduced in the very process of learning to be a professional. In these mechanisms of sex segregation, cultural gender beliefs act through self-conceptions to influence career decisions. This cloaking of gendered career decision-making in individualistic self-expression may be particularly resistant to social change, as undermining individuals' self-expressive freedoms would be a culturally unacceptable method to reduce gender inequality.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:24","2018-06-25 16:04:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New educational approaches, such as Service-Learning, are being used to teach technical skills as well as professional skills including ethics and an understanding of the social context of engineering solutions. There is a need, however, for frameworks and instruments to assess the effectiveness of these programs and others towards developing these skills. This study uses the lens of social responsibility to view the development of underlying dispositions, foundational to many of the professional skills that are needed for a more holistic profession. This thesis presents a new framework describing the development of social responsibility in engineering students. The iterative process between theory development and data is discussed, leading to a finalized model from which future instruments and studies can be designed. Next, the development of an instrument to assess beliefs of social responsibility, the Engineering Professional Responsibility Assessment (EPRA) tool, is presented, which was developed iteratively with both quantitative and qualitative data. Evidence of both reliability and validity are presented. Finally, results from a multi-institutional administration of the EPRA tool are analyzed for differences in beliefs of social responsibility between genders, academic ranks, and engineering disciplines (specifically Civil, Environmental, and Mechanical). Results showed that women had higher degrees of social responsibility than men, correlating with higher degrees of participation in volunteer activities. First-year students also tended to have higher degrees of social responsibility than senior and graduate students; predominately for female students. Finally, Environmental Engineering students had higher degrees of social responsibility than Civil Engineering students, who were higher than Mechanical Engineering students. Students in Environmental Engineering, over Civil or Mechanical, most often cited a desire to have a positive impact on society and to help others as motivation for their choice of major. These results form a foundation from which future studies regarding the development and effects of social responsibility in engineers can be conducted.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:24","2018-06-25 16:04:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the purpose of this research study was to: 1) study how social capital, students' engagement with institutional agents (for the current study, the researcher conceives an institutional agent as an academic advisor/counselor), and chilly climate at a community college can be measured, 2) investigate whether these factors contributed to the STEM aspirations and transfer intentions of these students, and 3) to introduce a new theoretical model for studying the STEM aspirations and transfer intentions in a population of female community college students. The conceptual framework for this investigation was based, in part, on the basic model that describes the process of social stratification from Blau and Duncan, (1967) and the concept of socialization and the influence of significant others, such as parents, siblings, teachers, and peers is included (Sewell & Hauser, 1980). The hypothesized model for the current study includes these concepts along with social capital within the family (Coleman, 1988), experiences with academic and counseling services (Stanton-Salizar 2011), and the incidence of chilly climate within the classroom or institution (Hall & Sandler, 1982). The STEM Student Success Literacy (SSSL) Sample College, is a large multi-campus institution located in the Southeast. Data for this study was collected online via a unique survey instrument, the STEM Student Success Literacy Survey (SSSL), conducted during the spring of 2013. The survey was administered to students taking courses at specifically identified community colleges. Using quantitative research analysis, including descriptive analysis, comparative analysis, factor analysis, and multinomial logistic regression, the researcher hypothesizes that factors attributed to social capital, contact with academic advisors/counselors, and chilly climate may have a significant impact on a female student's academic aspirations and their decision to transfer to a four-year institution and enroll in a STEM focused program. The results were compared to look at the differences among students who intended to transfer to a four-year institution and major in STEM, students who intended to transfer to a four-year institution and not major in STEM, and students who did not intend to transfer to a four-year institution. Significant differences within the test population were observed for the age, enrollment status, mother's level of education, number of math courses that a student had previously taken, and access to and interaction with academic advisors/counselors. No significant differences in the three groups were observed for race/ethnicity, the father's level of education, social capital within the family, or chilly climate. Based on the results of the factor analysis social capital, contact with advisor/counselors, and chilly climate were included in the final measurement model. Utilizing multinomial logistic regression, the STEM-SCCC model for Female Community College Students' Intentions to Transfer and Major in STEM found that age, enrollment status, contact and interaction with academic advisors/counselors, and number of math courses previously taken are predictive of a female students decision to transfer to a 4-year college/university and select a major in a STEM field. Findings of this investigation can be used by policy makers, administrators, and faculty to create more effective teaching and learning strategies that better serve female students enrolled at a community college and assist female students in their pursuit of a STEM education. Additionally the study contributes to the existing literature and adds to a growing knowledge base and a better understanding of female participation in STEM education.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Source type: dissertations&amp;theses; Object type: Dissertation; Object type: Thesis; Copyright: Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.; DOCID: 3787554231; PCID: 98572532; PMID: 66569; DocISBN: 9781321893618; DissertationNum: 3712492; PublisherXID: 3712492</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Department of Commerce is predicting that STEM job openings will grow 17% by 2018, which is a much faster rate than most other careers. These are among the highest-paying fields, in part because of the rising demand. Educational institutions in the United States will have to address this issue in order to compete economic leadership globally. High schools, community colleges, and four year institutions must increase awareness and efforts to recruit and retain more women in STEM majors. The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of female transfer engineering students at Midwestern University. Participants were asked what were their experiences as female engineering students at both the community college and the four-year institution? They were also asked to share about the community college transfer process, student involvement, relationship with faculty and advisors, sense of belonging, interaction with Faculty and staff/mentorship, peer interactions, and academic performance. Qualitative methods were used provide in-depth information regarding each student’s negative and positive experiences at both the community college and Midwestern University as a female transfer engineering student to provide a better understanding the different experiences of being an female engineering student at Midwestern University after transferring from a community college. Students reported how their interest in STEM was discovered early in their educational journey. They shared how their interest in STEM was cultivated in high school, but not so much in college. They also shared how participating in more social academic groups helped them to be more successful. Findings of the study suggested that there are common threads among the transfer process regarding their sense of belonging, interaction with faculty and staff, and family support. Students noted that, once they made the transition to college, there were not many individuals who continued to motivate them to continue in STEM. However, several participants shared that they had at least one mentor with whom they remained connected for guidance, motivation, and support. A few pointed to the lack of involvement of faculty and staff at both the community college and Midwestern University. Recommendations for practice include that it is essential to have services in place for students during and after they make the transfer to Midwestern University. Having a successful and smooth transfer experience can impact the student to turn a potential negative experience into a positive one.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A pre-test to select face stimuli first established that female scientists with more feminine facial appearance were judged as less likely to be scientists (Study 1). A second pre-test validated both positive and negative traits along the scientific and warmth dimension that were viewed as stereotypic of scientists. Study 2 found that science stereotypic traits were more readily associated with men than with women. Specifically, men were more associated with scientific and cold traits, and less associated with unscientific and warm traits, relative to women, and these stereotypes emerged whether assessed at an implicit level (using a go/no-go association task; GNAT) or an explicit level (using a percent estimate task), but were uncorrelated with one another. Moreover, gender ideology moderated explicit stereotypes but had no effect on implicit stereotypes; but greater assimilationism (i.e., believing that women should be more like men in the workplace) and segregationism (i.e., believing that men and women belong in separate roles) both predicted stronger gender-science stereotypes, whereas greater gender blindness (i.e., believing each person should be treated as a unique individual regardless of his or her gender) predicted weaker stereotypes. To examine whether gender prototypicality influenced the strength of implicit stereotypes, three versions of the GNAT instantiated gender using either generic names (control) or photos of high prototypical or low prototypical men and women (pre-tested in Study 1). Despite evidence that women’s facial prototypicality influenced perceived likelihood of being a scientist in Study 1, variation in prototypicality had very little impact on implicit gender-science stereotypes in Study 2. Other correlates of the gender ideologies are examined, and the implications, limitations and future directions of this work are considered.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on theories of women's career development and social-cognitive theories, it was hypothesized that ability, self-efficacy, positivity of role model influence, and role conflict would influence the career aspirations of these women. It was further hypothesized that the students' year in school would contribute to this model as a predictor variable. Five hundred forty-six students (representing a 71% response rate) from Iowa State University were surveyed by mail to evaluate the fit of this model. The structural equation modeling procedure revealed that the career aspirations of the two groups of women were directly predicted by self-efficacy and role conflict and indirectly predicted by year in school, academic ability, and positivity of role model influence. The model for this combined group of students represented a good overall fit, explaining 94% of the covariation among the measured variables. When the two groups of students were compared, identical models for women in the two groups revealed different relationships among the variables. In contrast to the women in math, physical science, and engineering majors, the relationships between ability and self-efficacy and between positivity of role model influence and self-efficacy were significantly lower in magnitude for women in the biological sciences group. In addition to providing a parsimonious model for conceptualizing the experiences of women in traditionally male fields, this study's findings have implications for increasing the number of women who aspire to advanced careers in these occupations. Primarily, this study suggests that interventions designed to increase the degree to which students are influenced positively by role models may increase their self-efficacy expectations and may decrease the amount of conflict they perceive between the roles of worker and spouse or parent. In turn, increasing self-efficacy and decreasing role conflict may increase the degree to which students aspire to leadership and top-level careers within mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering.","1997","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We see things as we are.” Capturing the transformation of career changing women from STEM fields to teaching","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/305238700?accountid=14692","This qualitative study tracks the journeys of four career changing women in STEM fields as they pursue a Master of Arts in Teaching degree and transition into teaching positions. Through analysis of archived writing, journaling, photo elicitation, interviews and member-checking, the study analyzes participants' thinking and learning at the beginning of their entrance into graduate school through to their second year of teaching. Using Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory, the study focuses on the challenges faced by the women, the catalysts for change, the durability of lessons learned in the teaching program and their degree of contentment with their decision given the liberty of hindsight. The study revealed that these women, who were mature, well-educated, mothers and experienced businesswomen, engineers and researchers, underwent dramatic changes in the way they perceived themselves and their views on teaching. The study also demonstrated that Transformative Learning Theory is a useful lens through which to analyze student growth, however, the theory falls short of allowing for a clear understanding of the role emotion plays in transformation. Recommendations are made based on understandings gained from this phenomenological case study regarding the evaluation of effective teacher education programs. A preliminary framework is suggested for use as an evaluation tool for teacher education programs. Most relevant, is the recognition that career changers, like traditionally-aged graduate students, benefit from participating in carefully designed full-year graduate programs including a spiraled curriculum with an experiential, authentic, collegial and reflective framework. Based on the findings of this study, the author suggests that career changers need time, support and experience in order to successfully transition into their role as teacher.","2010","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop talents in STEM, educators must understand the factors that contribute to an individual's retention in STEM domains, as well as the factors that act as barriers to success, such as the role that gender plays in the underrepresentation of women in certain STEM fields (e.g., computer science and engineering) and changes in recent decades in the process of selecting STEM majors and careers. The purpose of this study was to explore the influences that guide decisions related to the selection of majors and occupations during high school, post-secondary education, and early careers. Survey methodology was used to explore the perceptions of 360 Science Talent Search (STS) semifinalists and finalists during the years 1987-1989 and 1997-1999, and quantitative procedures were used to analyze the data. A majority (74.2%) of STS participants majored in a STEM field in college, and most (68.6%) currently work in a STEM field. A greater percentage of men selected computer science, engineering, physics, and mathematics majors, and a greater percentage of women selected biological science and chemistry. Belief in one's ability to achieve in STEM was a predictor of STEM majors in college and STEM concentrations in graduate school, but differences were found between men's and women's self-efficacy in STEM during high school and in college, as women had lower self-efficacy. Sex was a predictor of STEM majors in college, but perceived quality of academic courses was not. STEM majors also reported more satisfaction with their STEM courses in high school and college than non-STEM majors. In a departure from the results of previous research, the reasons that men and women selected occupations were similar, as were the reasons they chose to leave or not to enter STEM. The most frequently cited reason for attrition was interest in another (non-STEM) field. Participants placed little importance on other reasons for leaving STEM that were identified in previous research, such as competition, social isolation, or financial considerations.","2009","2018-06-25 16:04:25","2018-06-25 16:04:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research questions addressed if differences exist in undergraduate experiences and if differences are related to first career decisions. Social Cognitive Career theory and the Culturally Appropriate Career Counseling model guided the study. The results showed that academic challenges, continued interest in STEM fields, confidence, and interactions with faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate student peers shaped the attainment of various educational and career outcomes. A theme consistent for all participants was the experience of isolation in and outside of the classroom. Additionally, results showed the various influences of gender roles and culture on academic and career decisions. This study makes several important contributions to the understanding of how African American and Hispanic women with bachelor's degrees in STEM fields make career decisions. First, confidence in abilities especially in STEM fields is necessary. If not addressed early on during a student's educational journey, a lack of confidence in abilities has crippling effects on students' persistence and interest in STEM. Additionally, there appears to be a heightened level of isolation in STEM education, perhaps because the proportion of underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities is lower in STEM than in other academic fields. In the transition from degree to career, the multiple identities of Hispanic and African American women were all important parts of their decision making. Gender roles were most important for Hispanic participants, but all participants were concerned with balancing their future personal and professional roles. Furthermore, STEM workplaces are still seen as male-dominated and not flexible enough for women who desire to have both a professional and personal life.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the most general level, in this case study, I hypothesize that university Websites serve as communication and marketing tools in attracting students. At the most specific level, I postulate that civil engineering programs with Web pages depicting images of women and minorities would be more successful in recruiting and retaining women and students of color than civil engineering programs with Web pages displaying fewer or no images of women and minorities. The primary goal of this case study was to examine the relationships between Website information content and the recruitment and retention of women and minority pre-civil engineering students. The second, but equally important, goal was to investigate the reason(s) why, despite efforts to recruit and retain individuals from disenfranchised populations into STEM majors, students from these groups not only remain underrepresented in engineering, but leave this discipline at a much higher rate than their non-minority male counterparts. This case study focused on two Florida state university civil engineering programs and drew on ethnographic research methods. I used interviews, focus groups, Web pages, demographic sheets, and observations to examine the relationships between Website content and access to undergraduate civil engineering programs for women and students of color. The study sample involved 40 respondents, including pre-civil engineering students, civil engineering professors, and university administrators. Research findings suggested that Internet marketing has become a key strategy used by civil engineering programs in recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented groups. Additionally, the study revealed that both prospective and pre-civil engineering students use departmental Websites for communication and enrollment purposes. Last, but certainly not least, the study found that online climate is a significant factor in the recruitment and retention of women and students of color in civil engineering programs.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Honoring Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, this qualitative study is guided by a critical Indigenous research paradigm and the Diné concept of Hózhó, utilizing Indigenous Storywork (Archibald, 2008) and complementary narrative inquiry methods. Participant stories reveal three critical lessons regarding their life experiences as Native Americans in STEM: (1) how STEM was accessed in the home; (2) the challenges faced in college and graduate school; and (3) the many factors that supported the entirety of their STEM journeys. Findings underscore the paradigm shift that must occur from that of the dominant, reductionist way of thinking with a focus on the individual to that of the interconnected Indigenous way of being that integrates moral reflexivity and meaning into our collective lives. Through this lens, the stories of these Native STEM trailblazers reveal how the integrity of relationships—the relationships within and between the self and family; the relationships with their STEM disciplines; the relationships with their campus; and the relationships with their tribal nations and communities— sustains their STEM success by allowing them to create and find meaning in and beyond this life. This study is rooted in the future and ungirded by a tenor hope: hope that these stories of educational and professional attainment will transform discourses of deficiency and disempowerment to those of collective strength, possibility and action; hope that these stories of Native STEM success will blaze the pathways for future Native scientists; and hope that these stories of Native STEM success will serve to support self-sufficient, self-determining Indigenous communities.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2) What are the success strategies used by the African American women who overcame the barriers and completed STEM doctorate degrees? (3) What are the mentoring experiences of African American female STEM graduates? Using symbolic interactionism, social cognitive career theory, and black feminism as theoretical frameworks, this study used a mixed methodology to address the research questions. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with nine participants who had completed their bachelor's degrees in a STEM field from an HBCU located in the South of the United States; three participants had completed a STEM PhD, three were enrolled in a STEM PhD, and three had not enrolled in a STEM PhD. The obstacles they faced, the success strategies used to overcome the barriers and their mentoring experiences were explored. A Web-based survey was conducted, and data from 42 respondents were analyzed. Obstacles hindering enrollment were balancing life, career, and school, preference to work and make money as soon as possible, raising children, lack of financial aid and self-doubt. Obstacles during doctoral studies were lack of mentors/advisement, balancing life and career, raising children, lack of institutional and administrative support, academic and social integration, faculty tenure, isolation and loneliness, graduate school politics and research difficulties. Successful strategies that emerged related to doctoral completion were: be persistent, have a support system, choose an adviser wisely, continue to fight bias, stereotyping and judgmental factors, be in a community group, choose funding that compliments your research, self-motivation and spirituality. Most of the participants had negative graduate school mentoring experiences, and thirteen participants did not receive mentoring. The study identified obstacles faced by African American female doctoral students and also highlights practical successful strategies applicable to maneuvering doctoral studies for aspiring graduate students of not only African American descent, but all races.","2014","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research asked (1) how the students interact with the systems of College life to construct identities as students, women and scientists, and (2) what roles gender plays in this cultural interaction and identity construction. In contrast with other studies of girls and women in science, this one focused on the day-to-day events and thoughts of a small number of women (40). The main sources of data were electronic mail messages and personal interviews. The nature of electronic mail messages and the frequency with which they were sent made them especially suitable for constructing a real-time (rather than retrospective) picture of the women's experiences and feelings throughout a semester. Five areas of college culture predominated in students' communication. First, a strong presence of women across campus and in science contributed to a sense of power among the women of science. Second, and in contrast with other studies, the pedagogical, professional and personal relationships of the faculty with their students contributed significantly and positively to students' sense of worth, ability, and identities as scientists. Third, students' peer interactions with men and women (especially in science) tend to support rather than obstruct their academic goals. Fourth, the physical and human resources of the science building (Chamberlin Hall) are a powerful source of identification for the students and faculty who spend time there, together, often separated by department but joined by rituals and beliefs, including an all-but spoken sense that science students and faculty are somehow superior to their non-science peers, a belief that promotes both exclusively and group pride, and, at the same time, develops their identities as scientists. Finally, women science students balance multiple roles, commitments and relationships as they negotiate the events and emotions of their daily lives. The culture of success that exists for these students is like a net, with many systems and persons contributing to its composition, construction and maintenance, and working to keep women succeeding in science.","1996","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is an ethnographic examination of why this occurs and how women of color can be supported in studying science. Through participant observation in science classes, labs, and a program supporting high-achieving students of color, as well as interviews with minority women science students, the student identities celebrated by science departments, as well as those embraced by my informants, were uncovered. Cultural norms of science classes often differed from those of the women in the study. Only one identity—apprentice research scientist—was celebrated in science settings, although others were tolerated. The women tended to either embrace the apprentice research scientist identity, form an alternative science-oriented identity, or never form a satisfying science student identity. Women who were more racially marked were more likely to fall into the second and third groups. This study uncovered difficulties which women students of color faced more than other science students. In addition, it uncovered several seemingly neutral institutional features of science lectures and labs which actually served to discourage or marginalize women students of color. It revealed values held in common by the women in the study and how those characteristics (especially altruism and pride and pleasure in academic challenge) led them to study science. It also revealed strategies used by the most successful women science students, as well as by professors and programs most successful at supporting women of color in the study of science. Based on this study, increasing the participation of women of color in science holds the possibility of altering the basic values of science; however, institutional features and personal interactions within science departments tend to resist those changes, primarily by encouraging women of color to abandon their study of science.","2001","2018-06-25 16:04:26","2018-06-25 16:04:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While important information has been published concerning various factors that influenced women to pursue science careers (American Association of University Women, 1992; Debacker & Nelson, 2000; Samuels, 1999), very few research projects have allowed women scientists to share their personal experiences of what motivated them to become scientists in their own voices. The purpose of this inquiry was to investigate the elicited stories of seven women research scientists so that their retrospective motivational experiences with science as girls and young women inside and outside the formal school setting might be better understood. This inquiry examined specific motivational factors and experiences that encouraged or discouraged these women to pursue careers in science. These factors included the motivational influences of gender perceptions, science experiences, and social interactions. From the collective experiences offered, emergent themes were identified and interpreted. These motivational themes were compared with motivational findings in the literature review. Educational implications of the identified themes for these and other women considering careers in science, women's parents, science educators and society, are discussed.","2002","2018-06-25 16:04:27","2018-06-25 16:04:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This qualitative case study investigated the aspects of the graduate school experience that female doctoral students described as facilitating or impeding their successful degree completion in chemistry. I analyzed the graduate school narratives of twelve female participants who represented both successful and unsuccessful doctoral recipients from four advisors at one university. Participants identified four types of experiences that facilitated their retention in the doctoral program: feeling successful and confident in meeting the program requirements, having positive research experiences, receiving support from social networks, and being dedicated to career goals. Participants cited four kinds of experiences that impeded their continued participation in the doctoral program: having negative research experiences, feeling a lack of success and confidence in meeting the program requirements, changing career goals, and receiving no support from social networks. The graduate school experiences of participants who did and did not successfully attain their degree objectives differed in terms of four dimensions: pre-program experiences, academic experiences, advisory experiences, and social experiences. Based on these findings, I have proposed a model of attrition and retention that emphasizes the role that these unique program experiences play in shaping participants' sense of professional fit within the community of doctoral chemists, consequently contributing to their differential program outcomes. This study not only offers a new perspective on the phenomenon of female doctoral attrition in the sciences but also informs the development of more gender-inclusive graduate science practices and policies that will support the retention of female doctoral students.","2005","2018-06-25 16:04:27","2018-06-25 16:04:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first tier, eight participants provided their personal narratives through semi-structured interviews. In the second tier, five focus groups were conducted. Analysis of the data and interpretation was guided using the hermeneutic circle of understanding. The major findings of the study are that the participants felt a sense of belonging because of the ongoing support from family, peers, the campus-learning center, and the minority science program.

Nous avons aussi porté notre attention sur l'existence de différences sur le plan du genre ou du domaine d'études (génie, sciences biologiques, sciences physiques). Les résultats d'une analyse de facteurs selon l'échelle IOACDS (the Influence of Others on Academic and Career Decisions - Nauta & Kokaly, 2001) mesurant l'influence des autres sur les décisions académiques et professionnelles, indiquent que les modèles de comportement et les mentors influencent les étudiants de façons distinctes. Des différences significatives se sont révélées sur le plan du genre, du domaine d'étude et du pays où les étudiants ont fait leurs études du premier cycle. Bandura's (1969) Social Learning Theory proposes that our self-efficacy expectations determine whether we choose to engage in a particular behavior and whether we persist when faced with obstacles. Among sources of efficacy information are vicarious learning or modeling and verbal persuasion and support from others (Bandura, 1977, 1982, 1986). These ideas foreshadowed distinctions between role modeling and mentoring. Whereas mastery experiences were the primary sources of men's self-efficacy beliefs, women's self-efficacy beliefs depended on social persuasions and vicarious experiences (ZeIdin, Britner, & Pajares, 2007). Also drawing from Bandura's work, Hackett and [Betz] (1981) noted that women lacked strong efficacy expectations in maledominated areas owing to socialization experiences and fewer vicarious learning experiences compared with men. Similarly, [Campbell] and Skoog (2004) identified self-efficacy beliefs such as low self-confidence as the most influential internal barrier that deters women from choosing science as a career. Hackett and Betz also addressed the importance of social support and successful role models for women's representation in male-dominated career areas. Madill, Ciccocioppo, Stewin, Armour, and Montgomerie (2004) further corroborated the importance of role models and mentors, especially female instructors, in participants' math- and science-related self-efficacy expectations. Significant undergraduate country differences were found for the types of role models and mentors identified. Female academic advisors, both female and male undergraduate professors, and male graduate professors were more influential as role models for students who attended Canadian undergraduate programs than for those who attended Chinese undergraduate programs. When it came to mentors, more Canadian than Chinese undergraduates identified male undergraduate professors and male graduate professors as having influenced their career decisions. These influences were revealed only for specific types of role models and mentors. When considered collectively, however, those who had attended Canadian undergraduate programs were less influenced by role models than Chinese undergraduates and vice versa for mentors. Further research would be needed to examine these influences more fully. It is interesting, however, that when types of mentors were shown to have an influence on graduate students' career choices, the sex of the mentor was not an issue. This finding may indicate that mentoring as a practice makes an important difference regardless of the sex of the mentor (Zeldin & Pajares, 2000). Consequently, when male professors mentor, they may help compensate for the lack of female role models or availability of female mentors.","","2018-06-25 16:04:28","2018-06-25 16:04:28","","482-496","","4","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research aimed to describe the role of the Internet in undergraduate students’ academic and career perceptions in STEM areas. The purpose of the research was addressed in three parts. First, the attitudes of undergraduate students towards five functions of the Internet namely tool, toy, treasure, telephone and territory were described. Second, students’ STEM career-related perceptions were described in terms of their science and mathematics self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and attitudes towards a STEM career. Third, the relationship between the five Internet functions and the three STEM careerrelated perceptions was examined. The participants for this study were 566 undergraduate students from a large Southern university. The research design followed a mixed methods approach using multivariate analyses and content analyses. The findings of the research indicated that there was a small but meaningful relationship between undergraduate students’ Internet and STEM perceptions. In their daily lives, the students perceived the Internet more as a toy and a tool. For general career related purposes, they perceived the Internet more as a treasure and a tool. For STEM areas in particular, they perceived the treasure and toy dimensions of the Internet more relevant. Findings on the differences in students’ Internet and STEM career-related perceptions based on gender, major and enrollment in an Honors program are also discussed.","2013","2018-06-25 16:04:28","2018-06-25 16:04:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Gender Equity Options in Science (GEOS) project, a three-year intervention funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was based on earlier values-based career intervention programs for girls. These projects were the Talented At-Risk Girls: Encouragement and Training for Sophomores (TARGETS) program and its successor, Guiding Girls into Engineering, Math, and Science (GEMS). The GEOS intervention project extended the TARGETS and GEMS programs into higher education. The goal of the intervention was to provide guidance, support, and encouragement to first-year university Honors College women with an interest in science, technology, engineering, or math. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing self-beliefs, perceptions of university comfort, perceptions of mentoring, academic persistence decisions, valuing of education, career search behaviors, and choice of STEM majors and careers. Incoming Honors women were invited to attend a recruitment banquet. Of the 220 who attended the banquet over a period of three years, 168 women became involved in GEOS, with 89 women included in the GEOS intervention, 61 women in the waitlist control group, and 18 not completing all the components of the program. Overall, the GEOS intervention had a positive impact on educational self-efficacy and perceptions of mentoring. The positive pre-to-posttest changes in these two constructs were also maintained at the four-month follow-up. Additionally, for all participants, educational self-efficacy, perceptions of being mentored, and perceptions of the university environment accounted for 54% of the variance in academic persistence decisions. For all of the women, whether in the GEOS intervention or the waitlist control group, higher educational self-efficacy, stronger perceptions of mentoring, and more positive perceptions of the university environment were predictive of positive academic persistence decisions. The study also revealed that more freshmen women involved in the GEOS intervention identified STEM majors and careers than was expected. These findings are discussed in light of the need for future research and for college-based programs to enhance the retention of talented young women in the math and sciences. The role that counseling psychologists can play in these endeavors is also discussed.","2004","2018-06-25 16:04:28","2018-10-26 20:20:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\FVT57GFQ\Lowery - 2004 - Gender Equity Options in Science  Effect on attit.pdf","","Career; Education; Gender Equity Options in Science; Mentors; Social sciences; Women students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Females are underrepresented in STEM professions including academia, despite the fact that female educational attainment in all fields have increased significantly. Four research questions were used to guide this study and they are: 1) What personal factors affect females' ability to successfully persist in STEM faculty positions? 2) What social factors affect females' ability to successfully persist in STEM faculty positions? 3) What academic/institutional factors affect females' ability to successfully persist in STEM faculty positions? 4) What other notable factors affect females' ability to successfully persist in STEM faculty positions? The study was conducted using a 3-round modified Delphi technique. The participants were selected from STEM departments at 26 public institutions labeled as DocSTEM by the Carnegie classification of institutions. An online search yielded Email addresses for 447 female faculty in the above category who were invited to participate in the study; 73 responded and who constituted the study population while 43 completed Round 1 of the study, thus constituted the study sample. Meanwhile 38 of the 43 completed both Rounds 2 and 3. In Round 1 participants provided a list of factors, which they refined in Round 2 and validated in Round 3. At the end of Round 3 participants came to a consensus that several personal, social, and academic/institutional factors were influential to their success and persistence. The personal factors provided by participants were positive mental attitude, self-efficacy in STEM, intrinsic motivation, positive personality traits, and positive self-esteem. Participants also cited such social factors as, affirmation and encouragement, mentors and mentoring relationship, and supportive/enabling environments, as being influential to their success and persistence. Finally, the academic/institutional factors cited by participants included supportive/enabling environments, affirmative/equity policies, financial aid and research opportunities, networking and collaboration, institutional expectation of excellence, service opportunities, and collegiality. The retained consensus factors had a mean of 3-4 and a coefficient of variation less than 0.5.","2012","2018-06-25 16:04:28","2018-06-25 16:04:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was directed by two research questions: (1) What are the lived and told stories of Native women in engineering and technology who are leading initiatives to improve their Native communities and (2) How do Native women’s understandings of their identities influence their work and acts of leadership? The study employed narrative inquiry as the methodological framework and was guided by theoretical frameworks of identities as constructed, multiple, and intersectional (Crenshaw, 1989; Tajfel & Turner, 1979), hybridity, and “third spaces” (Bhabha, 2012). The inquiry was also informed by feminist theories of Native scholars (Green, 1983; Kidwell, 1978) and engineering education (Beddoes & Borrego, 2011; Riley, Pawley, Tucker, & Catalano, 2009). The narrative analysis presented three narratives, based upon interviews, field notes, observations, and documents: (1) the story of a Navajo woman working within a large technical corporation (Jaemie); (2) the story of an Akimel O’odham-Mexican woman working within a tribally-owned technical business (Mia); and (3) the story of a Navajo woman growing her own technical business (Catherine). The narratives revealed a series of impactful transitions that enabled Jaemie, Mia, and Catherine to work and lead in engineering and technology. The transitions revolved around themes of becoming professionals, encountering and overcoming hardship, seeking to connect and contribute to Natives through work, leading change for their Native communities, and advancing their professional selves and their Native communities. Across the transitions, a transformation emerged from cultural navigation to leadership for the creation of new hybrid spaces that represented innovative sites of opportunity for Native communities. The strength of the Native spaces enabled Jaemie, Mia, and Catherine to leverage their identities as Native women within the global context of engineering and technology. The narratives denote the power of story by contributing the depth and richness of lived realities in engineering and technology.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:28","2018-06-25 16:04:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While women represent half of the overall workforce and half of the bachelor's level population, women comprise only 26% of the employee base in U.S. aerospace corporations. The qualitative study of women's experiences highlights two areas of concern—recruitment and retention—by assessing both positive (attracting, assisting, and compelling) and negative (preventing, dissuading, or disenfranchising) events and influences on women in aerospace. Women currently working in aerospace were interviewed to understand the factors encouraging or detracting from recruitment and retention in the industry, such as harassment, discrimination, interest in the field, skills, opportunities, knowledge of the field, pay, work/life balance, and work density. The study indicated that women while experiencing some improvement still experience discrepancies in treatment due to negative factors. Suggestions for improvement include: proactive involvement in the community focusing on students at each grade level from elementary through college, recruitment aimed at female students, female internship programs, industry tours for female students, work with local city groups promoting STEM, add career enhancement and mentoring programs aimed at women, and educate industry personnel of the female culture and viewpoint.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:29","2018-06-25 16:04:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While 6% of the aerospace workforce is made up of aeronautical engineers, an additional 11.2% of the aerospace workforce is drawn from other engineering disciplines. Therefore, the analysis included all engineering sub-disciplines. In order to include women who had left the workforce, women in all industries were used as a proxy for women in aerospace. Exits to other fields were modeled separately from exits out of the workforce. The source of data was the National Survey of College Graduates. Women engineers were divided into the Baby Boom cohort (born 1945-1964), the Generation X cohort (born 1965-1980), and the Millennial cohort (born 1981-1997). A time-lag design was used to compare generational cohorts when they were the same age. The results of this study showed that generational cohort did not affect retention of women in engineering. However, generational cohort affected family formation decisions, with Millennial women marrying and having children later than their counterparts in the Generation X and Baby Boom cohorts. Generational cohort also affected the influence of motherhood on retention in the workforce, with Generation X and Millennial mothers more likely to stay in the workforce than their counterparts in the Baby Boom cohort. There was no significant difference between Generation X and Millennial women in the proportion of mothers who stayed in the workforce. Generational cohort influenced the reasons women left the workforce. Women in the Millennial cohort were more likely to cite not needing or wanting to work, while women in the Generation X cohort were more likely to cite family responsibilities. Among mothers in the Millennial cohort who were out of the workforce, the proportion who cited not needing or wanting to work as a reason for being out of the workforce was much larger than the proportion citing family responsibilities. Among mothers in the Generation X cohort who were out of the workforce, the relationship was reversed, with a larger proportion of women citing family factors than not needing or wanting to work. Generational cohort also affected the influence of motherhood on leaving engineering for another professional field, with Generation X and Millennial mothers more likely to stay in engineering than their counterparts in the Baby Boom cohort. Women in the Baby Boom cohort were more likely than women in the Generation X cohort to cite family factors as the most important reason they left engineering for another professional field. There was no significant difference between women in the Generation X cohort and women in the Millennial cohort regarding the most important reason they left engineering for another field. These results should help aerospace leaders understand the role of family factors in the workforce decisions of Millennial women engineers, and enhance the aerospace industry’s ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest for tomorrow’s aerospace workforce.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:29","2018-06-25 16:04:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of this, women are underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Women face additional barriers when forging careers within these fields and obtaining startup capital. This study examines female business ownership within the fields of hi-tech and biotech, and the factors that support startups by women throughout the state of California. As both of these industry sectors are known to cluster geographically around sources of venture capital, university research and development (R&D) investment, and skilled labor, the study explored how these factors influence women entrepreneurs through two methods of analysis, specifically, a quantitative GIS analysis using exploratory geo-statistical tools, and a qualitative analysis using semi-structured interviews of twenty women business leaders. Results from the study demonstrated that factors that encourage hub formation are prone to cluster geographically, that women receive less venture capital than their male counterparts, biotech as a sector is more open than hi-tech to women’s participation, high numbers of women starting businesses alongside their alma mater, and a high participation of women in business accelerators and incubators.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:29","2018-06-25 16:04:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gender gap that emerges as early as age nine is cumulative as girls move through school, and contributes to women arriving at college lacking the prerequisites for many college programs, and with low interest levels in math and science. Factors leading to the attrition of women from science include a lack of female role models, a competitive classroom ethos, and problems with undergraduate pedagogy and curriculum. Although we know that the science classroom remains an obstacle to women's continued participation in science education, little is known about what makes this setting so problematic. This study provides a qualitative, in-depth account of first year women students' experience in an introductory chemistry course at a large, public university. The examination focuses on women students' transition to college science and their responses to learning experiences in chemistry, the negotiation of their identities as scientists, the obstacles they confronted, and the extent to which undergraduate experiences influenced women's participation in science. Exploration of the everyday aspects of women's learning experience in chemistry revealed the salience of workload, engagement in the classroom, doing science work, and cooperative interaction, to women students' participation in science. Elaboration of women's movement from the access to participation phase of the science pipeline revealed the significant investment of time, tenacity and talent required for persistence. A full investment in science was viewed as necessary in order for women to resist the discouragement that came from grading practices that caused women to question their ability, having few friends in science, and the accepted practice of an early release from science. Keeping their sights on long-term goals and believing that they could disprove stereotypes, helped women remain in science. To recruit and retain women in science, undergraduate institutions must eliminate the inhospitable aspects of the culture of introductory science and foster the development of women's scientist identities.","2002","2018-06-25 16:04:30","2018-06-25 16:04:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feminist philosophy of science creates new and valuable ways of looking at the sciences by using gender as a category of analysis, or a lens through which to critically assess and constructively build projects in science, as well as in the philosophy of science. I employ feminist philosophy of science and a gendered lens in particular to examine the computing sciences. Starting specifically from the underrepresentation of women in computing, the project creates a platform for exploring the dimensions and contributions of feminist philosophy of science. This is not merely a critique of philosophy of science or a feminist review of computing, but a positive project in its own right, examining the epistemological structure of scientific inquiry, including the nature of objectivity, epistemic agency and the composition of an epistemic community, the importance of those epistemic communities, and the role of values in science. A central tenet of the work is that objectivity in science does not require leaving personal and political commitments at the lab door, but that social, ethical, cultural, and other values play a foundational epistemological role in science. Using gender as a lens uncovers some of those values for critical evaluation. This is not to deny the importance of the natural, empirical world in science. I argue that a philosophical position must at minimum account for our actual relationships—emotional, embodied, social, etc.—in the world and their impact on our theorizing and that dismissing the embodied experience of scientists results in a diminished understanding of the world in addition to diminished epistemological theories.","2003","2018-06-25 16:04:30","2018-06-25 16:04:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has led to considerable public and private sector efforts to recruit women into these arenas. In order to understand how schools and nonprofits engage today’s young women in STEM studies, this account includes time spent both in high school science classrooms and with ChickTech—a Portland-based organization that works to provide a pathway into tech careers for high school-aged girls. A historical perspective reveals that modern women aren’t treading into completely uncharted territory, in spite of the current disparity of representation in today’s STEM arenas. This perspective is offered via an examination of the lives of a group of extraordinary women who worked in astronomy at Harvard College Observatory from the late 1800s into the 1960s.

Logistic regression analyses showed that age is a more significant indicator of low interest and of low competence than gender, and that race does not play a significant role in any dimension.

Yet, in spite of the overwhelming presence of STEM in education, there is little research that critically examines the nature and development of STEM itself, especially STEM policy problems, and particularly those related to the recruitment and retention of women and people of color (POC) in these fields. This study maps how STEM policy problems related to women and POC are discursively constructed, and examines the assumptions embedded within the framing of these problems. Using feminist science studies and feminist poststructuralist discourse analysis, this study analyzes representations of diversity and diverse bodies in 25 major STEM equity policy documents. It demonstrates that these documents merely superficially address social justice in education, and to democratic ideals of equal opportunity. Rather, the push to ‘include’ more ‘diverse’ bodies in STEM is about allowing these formerly excluded people the opportunity to participate in the global marketplace. In these documents, gendered and racialized bodies are used as tools to enact neoliberal global dominance, and diversity in STEM is therefore one of many discursive tools employed to discipline and assimilate women’s bodies and racialized bodies into compliance with their subjection as human capital. As such, STEM policy documents actually reify difference and legitimate inequity in their representations of women and POC. This study also shows that STEM is at a pivotal moment in history in which there are possibilities for radical transformative practices that reshape the way STEM is done, taught, and represented, as well as who STEM is for.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:30","2018-06-25 16:04:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key organizations have played vital roles in the push for awareness and equity in STEM education held by both women and men. However, research has shown that there may be other possible factors contributing to the lopsidedness of women and men in STEM careers. The following phenomenological study explored the perceptions of seven women from Midwestern metropolitan cities in STEM leadership roles and how they attained and retained their leadership roles while influenced by stereotype threat. The study design consisted of participant personal narratives and one-on-one interviews. The information gathered in this study was divided into three distinct sections: stereotype threats with the impact of implicit theories of intelligence on women in STEM careers; the psychology of women in STEM careers; and communication theories as they currently relate to women in STEM leadership roles. The descriptions by these women and their lived experiences explored the influential factors that provided insight and information to the link between successful women in leadership positions and the gender inequities and underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:30","2018-06-25 16:04:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Questions as to why this is the case are not new; however, with the growing body of research, there seem to be more questions than answers. This study drew primarily from the vocational psychology literature, particularly Social Cognitive Career Theory, building on previous literature in this area by examining differences in career choices made over time by qualified women across different stages in the education-to-career pathway. The results of the present study indicate that among qualified women many of the SCCT personal and contextual variables are relevant to STEM career development. Moreover, findings from the present study support the hypothesis (Lent et al., 1994) that personal, environmental, and behavioral variables affect one another. An important aspect of the SCCT model is the acknowledgment that at any given point in time, certain variables will carry different weight (Lent et al., 1994). The current study provides further support for this and underscores the necessity of understanding and framing career development as a process, unfolding across several developmental stages. These findings, their generalizability, and implications for practice should be carefully considered in the context of several limitations that this sample was influenced by: limitations in reliability and selection of variables, lack of diversity within the sample, as well as the extraneous variables related to overall economic and political backdrop.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:31","2018-06-25 16:04:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research study explored the lived experiences of 15 African American females in the Denver, Colorado area who made the career choice, or were systematically or socially directed, to seek non-information technology careers. The United States may face severe shortages in informational technology workers unless the science and technology labor market becomes more representative of the general U.S. workforce. African American women, for example, are not well represented in information technology fields. Phenomenological interviews were conducted. This study used the modified Van Kaam method of analysis of phenomenological data described by Moustakas with taped and transcribed structured interviews. The QSR NVivo qualitative tool was used to assist with data analysis. Patterns and themes were identified that revealed a new understanding of the critical factors and barriers to reducing under-representation of African American women in information technology career fields. The study findings identified the critical need to focus on the combination of improving information technology career awareness to African American females and building the desire of African American females to pursue careers in the information technology career fields. Companies with information technology career positions should demonstrate consistent and proactive approaches to attracting, retaining, and promoting qualified women and minority candidates in the information technology industry.

The review of literature reports that African American students displayed an initial interest in STEM fields but more often than not chooses college academic majors in non-STEM fields. This research study examined the factors that affect African American undergraduate students' choice of college academic major (STEM versus Non-STEM). Multiple factors were examined to see if there were differences between students who choose to switch academic majors and those who do not. This study also examined if there are any predictive factors that lead students to choose STEM academic majors. The participants were Southern University Agricultural and Mechanical College, undergraduate students (N= 238) classified as juniors or seniors, enrolled in the spring semester 2008. An independent sample t-test did not reveal any statistically significant differences between students who switched majors' verus students who did not switch majors on 13 factors that might influence a student's choice of major. Two by two factorial ANOVAs revealed statistically significant results between gender on the variables desire to help others through research or practice, desire to teach, mathematics grades, science grades, and advance placement/gifted talented classes took in high school. Statistically significant results were found between major on desire to attend graduate school, desire to attend professional school, desire for a high salary, desire to help others through research or practice, job stability, opportunity for more scholarships, science perception, mathematics grades, and advanced placement/gifted talented classes took in high school. The interaction between gender and major yielded statistically significant results for interest in discipline or field, father's education, and science grades. Discriminate analysis revealed that high school preparation contributed most in predicting choosing a STEM college major.

Why is there underrepresentation of AAW in the STEM fields? Research evidence has demonstrated that AAW face social disparities such as race, gender, and class in the academy. A lack of adequate mentoring and financial resources to support their research efforts are related to these disparities and present fundamental challenges for them. To conduct the inquiry about the barriers AAW have to overcome to achieve success in STEM disciplines, a qualitative research method was used to “attend to social, historical, and temporal context. The findings of these studies are tentatively applied; that is, they may be applicable in diverse situations based on comparability of other contexts” (Mariano, 1995, p. 464). The researcher collected data by conducting in-depth interviews with five participants, using an open-ended conversational format to facilitate the development of trust, rapport, and maximum elicitation of stories from the participants.

Some signals received during recruitment can indicate that social-based inequalities and hierarchies may exist (social dominance theory; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). It is possible that women might perceive themselves as part of a subordinate group in fields where they are underrepresented, such as the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The current research examines participant gender and the effects of using traditionally feminine words, masculine words, or neutral words in recruitment material on participants’ ratings of STEM program attractiveness and perceptions of institutional belonging. Furthermore, one’s goal orientation can influence the type of goal one is attracted to and whether it will be adopted; the current research looks at the effects of one’s goal orientation and how that is related to the person’s efficacy regarding STEM recruitment materials (Elliott & Dweck, 1988). Additionally, a goal orientation intervention was conducted in an attempt to influence participants’ situational learning goal orientations and measured efficacy. While the gendered wording of the recruitment material did not influence participants’ ratings of attraction and perceived belongingness, women rated the STEM recruitment material as more attractive than men. Additionally, participants’ learning goal orientation was found to have a significant influence on their measured efficacy. The results of this research have implications for recruiting female applicants to STEM programs/careers and suggestions for organizational interventions and best practices in order to positively affect job outcomes.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:31","2018-06-25 16:04:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many programs hoping to increase the numbers of women in these fields and to contribute to women's advancement have focused on identifying and remedying gendered institutional barriers and practices that ultimately disadvantage women. This dissertation focuses specifically on one component of institutional barriers and practices: individual women's gender practices. The interactions in which women engage and the way women position themselves relative to other women professionally using gender practices contributes to the recreation of systemically gendered biases. Findings based on interview data from 30 women in academic STEM fields reveal that women draw on cultural, occupational and organizational expectations for gender to discursively position themselves as superior to other women. Discursive practices of differentiation and distancing allow women scientists to distinguish themselves from other women and align with the occupational and organizational requirements for success and professionalism within academic STEM fields. These discursive practices reproduce gendered cultural, occupational and organizational expectations, and, by extension, reproduce the gendered structures on which gender inequality in STEM fields is based.","2009","2018-06-25 16:04:32","2018-06-25 16:04:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At higher levels of education and within the workplace, the number of women declines even further and the attrition rate is high. Studies to explain this phenomenon abound and remedial action has been taken in many institutions. Nonetheless, the problem remains. There are women who have entered this environment, however, who are not only surviving but thriving. Through the lens of positive scholarship, this qualitative study explores characteristics of twelve high-achieving women of STEM to discover if there are common factors that have contributed to their success. The data show that successful women of STEM are enterprising, relational, self-aware, and have a positive perspective. These results suggest that the four factors, particularly through their juxtaposition, are foundational to the success of STEM women within the current culture of science. Furthermore, the behaviors, responses, and values of these women have likely contributed to systemic changes within their immediate environments and perhaps even beyond. Research has shown that positive behaviors and values can be adopted by others and integrated deeply into their psyches. Therefore, the women of this study, and others like them, could serve as role models for colleagues and peers to support the development of these factors of success in others. Women, and men, of STEM may thereby learn new ways to approach difficulties, to create new avenues for success, and to bring forth positive change within themselves and their environments.","2012","2018-06-25 16:04:32","2018-06-25 16:04:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing structure of the academic tenure process in universities and STEM graduate training programs further add to the gap as scientists frequently do not have guidance or opportunities to learn effective science communication skills nor pedagogy. Thus, scientists for these and other reasons are sometimes ineffectual communicators of science. Museums endeavor to decrease the separation between public audiences and scientists by bringing scientists into museum spaces and facilitating discussions about current science through exhibits and public programs. The Portal to the Public program at Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA provides a useful case to study the effects of face-to-face interactions with the public on the scientists involved in science outreach. Portal to the Public provides scientists with professional development opportunities in science communication, and events to engage in dialogue with public audiences. The study focused on the effects of Portal to the Public on master's and doctoral students, who are developing into future science researchers and science educators. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven graduate student scientists who had participated in the program during 2007 to 2010. The results suggest the program positively impacted science communication skills, science teaching skills, and time dedicated to science outreach activities. Surprisingly, Portal to the Public influenced the self-perception of the graduate student scientists in the study. Interest to continue with science outreach in future career stages maybe attributed to positive experiences engaging with public audiences, and positive experiences being mentored by museum educators through the professional development workshops. The study provides evidence that positive science outreach experiences can have a strong impact on emerging scientists' ability to communicate science, and a strong impact on forming an identity as a science communicator.","2012","2018-06-25 16:04:32","2018-06-25 16:04:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the importance of preparing socially responsible graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to address the current state of poverty and inequality, higher education research focused on STEM education has predominantly framed notions of student success with respect to the maintenance of U.S. global economic competitiveness, largely focusing on steering more students into the STEM disciplines and solely developing their STEM competencies to specifically fill workforce roles. The few studies that have examined the development of STEM students' outcomes critical to promoting a more equitable society have generally examined the impact of one program or course. To address this gap in the literature, this study used frameworks of undergraduate socialization (Vreeland & Bidwell, 1966; Weidman, 1989, 1979) to examine the individual experiences and institutional contexts that affect STEM bachelor's degree recipients' development of two democratic educational outcomes seven years after college entry: social agency and values toward conducting research that will have a meaningful impact on underserved communities. In order to properly account for the nested structure of the data, this study employed multilevel modeling on a national sample of 6,341 STEM bachelor's degree recipients across 271 institutions. Longitudinal student data from the 2004 CIRP Freshman Survey and 2011 Post-Baccalaureate Survey was merged with institutional data from the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System and CIRP Faculty Surveys. Various undergraduate socialization experiences and institutional contexts were found to influence STEM students' democratic educational outcomes, including academic majors, participation in student organizations and research, experiences with faculty, and peer and STEM faculty normative contexts. Findings suggest the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to supporting long-term student development by providing individual experiences and promoting institutional contexts that facilitate students' democratic educational outcomes. The findings have implications for curriculum and program development in STEM education to maximize the development of STEM students' values toward using research and sociopolitical involvement to promote a more equitable society.","2014","2018-06-25 16:04:32","2018-06-25 16:04:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underrepresentation of women in STEM may be attributable to a variety of factors. These may include different choices men and women typically make in response to incentives in STEM education. For example, STEM career paths may be less accommodating to people who are less resilient. Another factor may be that there are relatively few female STEM role models. Perhaps strong gender stereotypes discourage women from pursuing STEM education and STEM jobs. The factors that contribute to success and the barriers that impeded success must be identified before any steps can be taken to improve the educational outcomes for women in STEM disciplines. Consequently, relatively little is known about the role of resilience in academically successful adult women in rural community colleges enrolled in STEM disciplines and the mechanisms that underlie the performance deficits that occur as a result of stereotype threat effect. This mixed method study addressed those knowledge gaps by determining: (1) if high resilience is positively correlated to high grade point average for women enrolled in STEM disciplines in rural community colleges in North Carolina, and (2) if stereotype threat effect is a risk factor for these women. Quantitative data were collected by using ""The Resilience Scale"" (Wagnild & Young, 1987) and through examination of grade point average of students from Datatel data management software. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured focus group interviews. Findings from this study indicate high resilience is positively correlated to high grade point average for women enrolled in STEM disciplines in rural community colleges in North Carolina, and stereotype threat effect was a risk factor for low-scoring women (i.e. those women who reported resilience scores less than 121 and grade point averages lower than 2.70) and was not a risk factor for high-scoring women (i.e. those women who reported resilience scores of 147 or higher and grade point averages of 2.70 or higher). Overall, qualitative data analysis revealed both high-scoring and low-scoring women in STEM disciplines were affected by stereotype threat effect. However, low-scoring women were negatively impacted by stereotype threat and high-scoring women were able to use pressures associated with stereotype threat as motivation for success. Based on results from this study four principal factors were found that influence the success of women in STEM disciplines. These factors include elimination of stereotype threat, enhancement of resilience of female students, expansion of female gender representation on community college campuses, and development of positive instructor-student and advisor-student relationships. While this study does not, and cannot, explain why gender differences in STEM exist, it does provide data and insight that will enable more informed policymaking for community college administrators in order to increase success of women in STEM disciplines. The findings provide definitive evidence of a need to encourage and support women in STEM education with a goal of gender parity.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:33","2018-06-25 16:04:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994) has increasingly guided much of this research, particularly research that has been concerned with career pathways for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Women and racial/ethnic minorities are largely underrepresented in STEM, increased research about the factors contributing to these disparate numbers in these domains is important as employment opportunities in STEM are on the rise. Thus far the proximal contextual affordances studied have minimally included research from social psychology regarding stereotype threat (Steele, 1997). Stereotype threat research has demonstrated that negative stereotypes about one's social identity can influence performance (e.g., women in mathematics). The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationships among stereotype threat and academic self-efficacy for women majoring in STEM fields. As coping efficacy has been shown to mediate the impact of barriers on academic self-efficacy and interests and moderate the relationship between variables related to identity and self-efficacy, the present study examined the impact of coping efficacy on the relationship between stereotype threat and self-efficacy. Participants were 232 undergraduate women majoring in STEM fields. Stereotype threat was measured by stigma consciousness (Pinel, 1999) and the stereotype vulnerability scale (Spencer, 1993). Coping efficacy was measured by the Coping With Barriers scale (CWB; McWhirter, 1997) and academic self-efficacy by Lent et al.'s (1987) Self-Efficacy for Academic Milestones (AM-S) index. Responses were collected online and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results of the mediation model showed a significant negative path from stigma consciousness to academic self-efficacy. When coping efficacy is included in the model, the direct path was no longer significant, but a significant indirect effect is present, suggesting coping efficacy's role as a mediator. Conversely, a moderation model was tested, showing that the interaction of coping efficacy and stigma consciousness was significant on academic self-efficacy. These findings offer an important addition to the proximal contextual barriers framework within SCCT. Additionally, they demonstrate that identity and environment interaction can be harmful to women's career development in STEM.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:33","2018-06-25 16:04:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were collected through a survey from 40 participants and in-depth interviews with eight of them. The survey was used to explore the participants’ educational experiences from elementary school through college and on their STEM-related careers, whereas the individual interviews were used to gain insights into their perspectives as STEM professionals. The results of this study indicate that most of these African American STEM professionals attributed their choice of a STEM career to early exposure to and positive experiences in science and mathematics mediated by teachers and/or parents. Furthermore, the positive experiences and success in science and mathematics continued in high school and college, further solidifying their choice of a STEM career. However, for almost half of the participants, attending a HBCU seems to have played an important role in their enjoyment of and success in a STEM major. HBCUs provided them with role models and the necessary support and encouragement to succeed in their pursuit of a STEM degree. The results of this study illustrate the various factors that play a role in preventing leakage in the minority STEM pipeline: K-12 experiences mediated by parents and teachers; support systems in college and the workplace mediated by counselors, professors, peers, and administrators; and policies that facilitate integration and the development of such support systems. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge on minorities in STEM by focusing on what works, instead of focusing on the deficit model and what does not work. It is hoped that these results help validate the efforts of those who work towards a more equitable representation of the STEM fields.","2017","2018-06-25 16:04:33","2018-06-25 16:04:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem is exacerbated at historically White institutions (HWI) where Black women are simply absent as engineering research and teaching staff. The absence of Black African women in the academy occurs despite Black African women enrolling and graduating with engineering postgraduate degrees making them eligible for academic jobs. Furthermore, despite Black African women representing the largest population in South Africa at 41% of the population overall, and affirmative action policies in place, engineering academic spaces remain predominantly White and male, not representative of the country’s population. In fact White women are overrepresented in engineering academe and in some cases White women are the only female presence in engineering higher education employment. If Black African women are graduating with engineering degrees why are they not equally represented in engineering academe as their White female counterparts? How can the absence of Black African women engineering academics be explained? I use Charmaz’s constructivist grounded theory (CGT) to understand the career choice processes of Black African engineering alumni women in South Africa to explain why their career choices thus far have not included the academy. Approaching the research from a social constructivist paradigm, loosely guided by a conceptual framework of African feminism(s) and CGT, and borrowing from life history interview methods this study addresses the underrepresentation of Black African women in engineering academe. Findings indicate Black African women’s career choices in engineering are driven by prospects of socio-economic mobility and family/community responsibilities, a product of historical circumstances during apartheid that created social inequalities with Black families relegated to lower socio-economic statuses. In this study career choices were heavily influenced by teachers in pre-tertiary schooling, student academic competencies in mathematics and science, and industry practices that included providing bursary funds to only support engineering higher education endeavors, thereby dictating to students from low income households which careers to pursue especially in cases where the absence of such funding meant one would not be able to afford university costs. The academy was not viewed as a place of work seen instead as a transitory space. The image of the academy as made up of older White males also created the perception that it was not a place for Black women. The combination of the factors influencing career choices in school and the image of the academy as an unwelcoming space for Black women explains Black women’s absence in South African engineering academia. Postsecondary institutional leaders should work on changing the image of the academy and marketing it as a career option for students in pre-tertiary and postsecondary education. Institutional culture and representation needs to reflect the diverse student population while actively working to ensure all students, academic and administrative staff feels welcome and valued.

African American girls remain an underrepresented population within the STEM-fields despite their demonstrated interest and aptitude in science. Within the STEM-circuit, African American girls who once showed interest and promise in STEM, are pushed out due to negative experiences within science spaces where many are marginalized and their interests are suppressed. Critical science education scholars have called for culturally relevant pedagogical practices that honor the cultures and experiences of students of color (Emdin, 2010) and science education scholars have led the charge to examine the experiences and identity development of girls of color in science (Calabrese Barton, et al. 2012; Hanson, 2009). This study builds on preexisting work by centering its focus on the science identity development of African American girls within a culturally relevant science counterspace. To challenge the dominant discourse concerning their science education experiences, their identity development is analyzed through a critical race, Black feminist theoretical lens. Through a multiple qualitative methods design, this project illuminates the identity development of African American girls within the counterspace by utilizing a three-dimensional model that examines their competence, performance, and recognition in science (Carlone & Johnson, 2007). The culturally relevant curriculum employed within the counterspace allowed participants to learn through their interests and build critical consciousness through engaging in meaningful dialogue concerning the role of race and gender on the underrepresentation of African American women in STEM.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:33","2018-06-25 16:04:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, female students may have fewer employment opportunities. This study explores one potential way to reduce the gap between male and female career aspirations and choices. Specifically, it looks at the impact of bringing women with careers in math- and science-related fields into high school classrooms as role models. The study uses surveys to measure pre- and post-visit perceptions of science and scientific work as well as student's short-term interest in math and science courses. In addition to these surveys, student comments were collected about the role model visits. While the overall study yielded little statistical significance, it also indicated that the role model visits had some impact on student perceptions and choices and raised questions that warrant further study.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:34","2018-06-25 16:04:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the study was to determine the environmental perceptions of female SEM students in the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Program at the University of Michigan. The WISE-RP (Residence Program) is an existing living and learning education program at the university that was designed to facilitate the successful retention and graduation of undergraduate female SEM students in the capacity that the admissions statistics should logically imply. The objectives of the study included identification of the perceptions of female students that contribute to, and foster retention of students participating in the WISE-RP program. The knowledge obtained from this evaluation will guide the University of Michigan in formulating specific interventions and retention approaches, both in and out of the classroom. This was achieved by identifying (among other things) commonality of experiences, and female student's perceptions of acceptance, integration and interactivity. The data used in this secondary analysis was collected over a 2 year period (1999–2001). The primary instrument used for data collection was a structured interview protocol utilizing focus groups. The population and samples studied were comprised of: a research project consisting of 36 focus groups from WISE-RP, University Research Opportunity Program, and the University Research Opportunity in Residence Programs; the sample size of the initial project was 180 first year SEM male and female students. The research project consisted of working with a senior research team at the University of Michigan to develop a structured interview instrument, pilot the instrument, and select focus groups. Content analysis was conducted on the open-ended focus group questions. Three themes emerged from the data set: (a) general contributing factors to retention, (b) support networks and programmatic features that contributed to retention, (c) individual/gender specific challenges that students faced. It found that the initial mission of the program has been accomplished, as evidenced by the findings of this study. The University is graduating and retaining female SEM students at a higher rate than at the program's inception. The challenges for the University at this point include: increasing numbers of female SEM faculty, enhancing and focusing the living learning community mission of the program, integrating student affairs components to the program features on an administrative level, committing to longitudinal analysis and assessment of individual incoming students toward identifying strengths and weaknesses, and finally—committing increased resources to these objectives.","2005","2018-06-25 16:04:34","2018-06-25 16:04:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each of the women successfully earned a Bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences in spite of being the minority in a male-dominated field. Examination of individual characteristics and experiences of each woman support the theory that successful women in atmospheric sciences enter into the degree program with a strong science self-efficacy and that self-efficacy is built upon as the women continue working toward their degree. All women in this study display characteristics of individuals who are resilient—who are able to continue on in the pursuit of personal goals in the face of adversity. During their tenure as an undergraduate, they use their self-efficacy and resilient nature to develop social capital through relationship building. This social capital provides them with an entrée into the atmospheric sciences community and facilitates their further development of meaningful, professional relationships. The findings of this research are used as a scaffold to develop recommended structures, both physical and social, that atmospheric science departments can develop in order to promote the success of women in their undergraduate programs.","2008","2018-06-25 16:04:34","2018-06-25 16:04:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of the unique school and community setting these students experience, the decision-making process was examined with particular focus on characterizing the relationships that influence the process. While the theoretical framework that informs this study was that of social capital, its primary purpose was to inform the school’s processes and policy in support of increased Latino participation in the math and science pipeline. Since course selection may be the most powerful factor affecting school achievement and college-preparedness, and since course selection is influenced by school policy, school personnel, students, parents, and teachers alike, it is important to understand the beliefs and perceptions that characterize the relationships among them. The qualitative research design involved a phenomenological study of nine Latino students, their parents, their teachers and counselors, and certain support personnel from the high school. The school’s and community’s environment in support of academic intensity served as context for the portrait that developed. Given rapidly changing demographics that bring more and more Latino students to suburban high schools, the persistent achievement gap experienced by Latino students, and the growing dependence of the world economy on a citizenry versed in the math- and science-related fields, a deeper understanding of the decision-making processes Latino 12 students experience can inform school policy as educators struggle to influence those decisions. This study revealed a striking lack of knowledge concerning the college-entrance ramifications of continued course work in math and science beyond that required for graduation, relationships among peers, parents, and school personnel that were markedly lacking in influence over the decision a student makes to continue, or not, course work beyond that required for graduation, and a general dismissal of the value of math- and science-related careers. Also lacking was any evidence of social capital within parental networks that reflected intergenerational closure.","2009","2018-06-25 16:04:34","2018-06-25 16:04:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, as computer usage cuts across diverse aspects of modern culture, the computing sciences have moved to the forefront of STEM disciplines (Carver, 1995; Jackson, Charleston, George, & Gilbert, in press). As the proliferation of global competition ensues, the United States must reach beyond its traditional reliance on White, Asian, and more increasingly Indian males as the only sources of viable scientific and technical talent if it is to remain internationally competitive and keep up with labor market demands (Gilbert & Jackson, 2007; Jackson, Gilbert, Charleston, George, & Grenell, in press). Though African Americans have historically been the foremost recipients of economic and societal ills which have prevented them from productively contributing to the growing field of computing sciences, they are a viable pool of candidates that the United States can no longer afford to ignore. This study was designed to examine, explore, and identify what factors helped to cultivate the decision to pursue the computing sciences through degree attainment among African Americans. Additionally, this study was designed to better understand the type of exposure, programming, and content-based elements that sparked the career aspirations of African Americans within the computing sciences; ultimately leading to their persistence and degree attainment in a computing sciences-related field.","2010","2018-06-25 16:04:34","2018-06-25 16:04:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gap is even greater in the representation of women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This study examined pre-college intervention strategies provided by the University of Southern California's Math, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program, as well as the relationships and experiences that contributed to the success of underrepresented female high school students in the STEM pipeline. A social capital framework provided the backdrop to the study. This qualitative study takes an ethnographic approach, incorporating 11 interviews, 42 hours of observation, and document analysis to address the research questions: How does involvement in the MESA program impact female students' decisions to pursue a mathematics or science major in college? What is the role of significant others in supporting and encouraging student success? The findings revealed a continuous cycle of support for these students. The cycle started in the home environment, where parents were integral in the early influence on the students' decisions to pursue higher education. Relationships with teachers, counselors, and peers provided critical networks of support in helping these students to achieve their academic goals. Participation in the MESA program empowered the students and provided additional connections to knowledge-based resources. This study highlights the interplay among family, school, and the MESA program in the overall support of underrepresented female students in the STEM pipeline.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:35","2018-06-25 16:04:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gap in educational success and achievement among low-income, first generation, traditionally marginalized students continues to be significant. California's educational system needs to stop the hemorrhaging from its educational pipeline, also known as the P-20 pipeline, of all students, especially those groups of students with larger gaps in educational attainment. One potential path towards fixing California's educational pipeline for all students is to form and keep partnerships with programs such as Upward Bound, AVID, and Math Engineering Science Achievement (MESA). In 2010-11, the California Department of Education (CDE) reported that over 51% of students enrolled in California's school system and 51% of all California high school seniors were Latino were Latino. Of the 231,231 Latino high school seniors, 79%, graduated. However, of those that graduated, only 26%, met University of California/California State University (UC/CSU) college entrance requirements. Even though 79% of Latinos graduated, 74% did not qualify to apply to a UC or CSU. If the majority of Latino students continue to fall through holes in the educational pipeline, companies will continue to look abroad to fill STEM jobs that remain unfilled by American workers (California Department of Education [CDE], 2012). Alongside the U.S.'s current economic woes, the lack of college preparedness and knowledge by parents and students has led to a decrease in first generation, low-income Latino students' higher education enrollment (Camacho & Lord, 2011). With strong and positive leadership from family, supplemented by the MESA program, these youths can exert their resiliency, face adversity, and overcome extraordinary barriers. Leaders in education such as teachers, coordinators, advisers, administrators, and parents are in the best position to teach students about resilience (Ginsburg, 2007). The American Psychological Association (APA Practice Central, n.d.) defined resilience as, ""the ability to handle stress and respond more positively to difficult events"" (para. 1). MESA is structured to help foster resiliency and academic success in first generation, low-income, traditionally marginalized students. This study examined the role that leadership and programs such as MESA have in fostering or increasing resiliency attributing to increased academic success among first generation, low-income Latino students in the STEM fields.","2014","2018-06-25 16:04:35","2018-06-25 16:04:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The substantial amount of investment given to STEM schools required the investigation of the influence of STEM schools on students' academic achievement. The research from the first study in this dissertation focuses on the effectiveness of Texas STEM schools (T-STEM academies) from a broader perspective by comparing T-STEM academies in different regions. The second study focuses on the influence of STEM practices on students' academic achievement by comparing T-STEM academies to traditional high schools longitudinally. The third study focuses on the effectiveness of T-STEM charter schools in comparison to non-T-STEM charter schools. Lastly, the fourth study highlights the importance of the duration of implementation by focusing on the effect of STEM designation in middle school and the years of designation as a T-STEM academy. Results from the first study showed that T-STEM academies located in different regions did not differ in terms of students' mathematics achievement longitudinally. Schools in regions were supported by Regional Education Service Centers (ESC) in terms of assistance on instruction. According to the findings of the first study, students' mathematics achievement in T-STEM academies in different ESCs was not statistically significantly different. In the second study, students' mathematics, reading, and science achievement did not differ longitudinally according to their schools: T-STEM or traditional high schools. However Asian, and at-risk students in T-STEM academies showed better mathematics and reading growth. Students' mathematics and reading scores, who were in T-STEM charter schools and non-T-STEM charter schools, differed over time. Hispanic students in T-STEM charter schools showed higher positive growth over time than Hispanic students in non-T-STEM charter schools. Lastly, students who attended T-STEM academies in middle school had higher Algebra I and Algebra II scores in high school than their peers, who enrolled in T-STEM academies in ninth grade. In addition, if a T-STEM academy had a designation as an academy for at least four years, students in these academies had higher scores than their counterparts. Overall, results from this dissertation study showed that T-STEM academies partially fulfill their promise. Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students in T-STEM academies showed better growth than their counterparts. The major participants of T-STEM academies were Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students. The results from the four studies showed that instruction in T-STEM academies was beneficial to one group of minority (i.e., Hispanic) students as well as economically disadvantaged students. Moreover, this dissertation study highlights the importance of implementation in schools. Students who are taught using STEM practices in middle grades are highly likely to reach desired results. In addition, the duration of the designation as a STEM school plays an important role on students' academic achievement.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:35","2018-06-25 16:04:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Mathematics & Science Academy (MSA), is a STEM-themed, public magnet school in Southern California whose mission is to increase the nation’s pool of graduates in mathematics and science. It is 1 of the many schools and programs in place to increase the United States (U.S.) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. This study, designed as a qualitative case study investigated how MSA has influenced female, African American students who attended a STEM magnet school in their educational pathways. Data was collected from 9 former African American, female graduates from the MSA class of 1998 primarily through interviews. Additional data was received from a pre-interview questionnaire and artifacts from their high school experience. This study yielded 4 conclusions. First, the push to study STEM must be intentional and should be influenced by more factors than the school environment alone. Without mentors and an explicit thrust towards STEM, other factors may lead students away from STEM majors. Second, family and society are especially influential in directing a student’s pathway. They along with the navigational and resistant capital gained by a student can divert a student’s chosen path. Third, students are influenced by multiple factors (e.g. community, school environment, peers, family) each of which can impel them in a certain direction. Lastly, post-secondary (college) educational experiences are highly influential on choice of major and career pathways. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations were made for leaders and administrators of STEM-themed magnet schools to consider, when developing programs that will encourage students to pursue STEM careers.","2016","2018-06-25 16:04:35","2018-06-25 16:04:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were two main purposes. First, the study examined gender differences in math/science major and career choices and three cognitive variables: math self-efficacy, perceptions of the value of math, and attributions for math performance among math/science-oriented college students. Second, the study assessed the relationship between these three cognitive variables and exam grade, persistence in math coursework, traditionality of major and career choices and math/science-relatedness of major choices. Eighty-two students, 37 women and 45 men, were surveyed at four points during an academic semester while students were enrolled in an entry-level college calculus course. Participants completed the Math Self-efficacy Scale, the Perceptions of the Value of Math Scale and either the Math Attribution Scale of the Attribution Questionnaire. In addition, participants' major and career plans, persistence in math coursework and exam grades were obtained. Results indicated that women aspired to more traditional, less math/science-oriented majors and careers than men. However, in contrast to expectations, there were no gender differences in the cognitive variables. Further, lack of gender differences in high school math GPA, college GPA, Math SAT or parent's occupational status indicated that among math/science-oriented students other variables influenced gender differences in career choice. Additional findings revealed that perceptions of the value of math fairly consistently predicted math/science career choices. Little support was provided for the utility of math self-efficacy or attributional style as a predictor of these choices. However, attributional style did influence math self-efficacy, suggesting that attributions may be related to other cognitive processes. They appear less useful as a direct predictor of behavior. It was concluded that even though perceptions of the value of math, and to some extent, math self-efficacy influenced math/science career choice, the cognitive variables investigated in the present study did not explain women's under-representation in these fields. Rather, the influence of sex-role stereotypes, gender composition of a field and outcome expectations were discussed as variables which may restrict women's math/science career aspirations.","1989","2018-06-25 16:04:35","2018-06-25 16:04:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stereotype vulnerability was identified as a condition in which members of stigmatized groups experience a sense of vulnerability to devaluation–a devaluation that alleges a category-based inferiority. In all five studies stereotype vulnerability had a pronounced effect on women's math performance. In Study 1, equally-prepared men and women took difficult math and English tests. They performed equally well on the English test, but on the math test where women were vulnerable to stereotype-based evaluations they underperformed in comparison to men. In Study 2, equally-prepared men and women took either a difficult or an easy math test. We reasoned that on the easy math test women would be less vulnerable to stereotype-based evaluations, as their performance would make a stereotype-consistent evaluation less plausible. Women and men performed equally well on the easier math test, but women again underperformed in comparison to men on the difficult test. In Study 3, we directly manipulated the relevance of the gender stereotype to performance on the math test. Equally-prepared men and women took a math test that was characterized as producing gender differences and a math test that was characterized as not producing gender differences. When subjects thought gender was relevant to the test, women underperformed in comparison to men; however, when the stereotype was irrelevant, women performed just as well as men. In Studies 4 & 5, we manipulated subjects' expectancies about the test demonstrating that the effects of the stereotype vulnerability manipulations in these experiments were not mediated by their effect on subjects' performance expectations. These experiments also demonstrated that when women could attribute their problems and frustrations on the test to the nature of the test rather than to their gender, their stereotype vulnerability decreased and their performance increased. The theoretical significance of stereotype vulnerability was outlined and the practical implications were discussed.","1993","2018-06-25 16:04:36","2018-06-25 16:04:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three studies tested whether men and women's reactions to negative or positive feedback differed across academic domains. In Study 1, attributions to ability were influenced by gender: women were more likely to attribute failure on a putative math test to a lack of ability than failure on a putative verbal test, whereas men showed a nonsignificant tendency to attribute failure on a putative verbal test to a lack of ability than failure on a putative math test. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 for failure and showed that gender differences in attributions for alleged failure persisted when statistically controlling for past math experience. In addition, the more women attributed failure on a math test to their ability, the less likely they were to persevere in the math domain, suggesting that performance attributions affect subsequent motivation. In Study 3, women were given a test described as either of their math ability or their general cognitive ability and their implicit and explicit gender-math stereotypes were assessed. Stereotype threat did not influence performance attributions. Contrary to predictions, in the threat condition, but not the reduced threat condition, the more women implicitly stereotyped women, the less they attributed mathematical failure to their own ability. Findings are discussed in terms of gender stereotypes influencing performance attributions and perseverance following setbacks. Gender-math stereotypes are known to undermine women's confidence and performance on mathematical tasks (e.g. Spencer, Quinn & Steele, 1999). Thus, stereotypes may also affect women's attributions for their math performance and their motivation to succeed in quantitative fields.","2005","2018-06-25 16:04:36","2018-06-25 16:04:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Female participants were given either diagnostic or non-diagnostic math test instructions, and were then provided with social comparison information about an outstanding male or female mathematician. Consistent with the hypotheses, women performed worse on a challenging math test after reading about a first-year male university student who excelled in mathematics, as compared to women who received identical female social comparison information or women in a control condition. Surprisingly, however, no effect of the stereotype threat manipulation emerged, and the manipulations had no reliable effect on women's implicit or explicit attitudes towards mathematics. Explanations for these findings and additional strategies to buffer the effect that male social comparisons may have on women's math test performance are discussed.","2007","2018-06-25 16:04:36","2018-06-25 16:04:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discrepancy in women's representation between STEM and other fields cannot adequately be explained by factors such as women's need to balance work and family (medicine and law are both extremely demanding careers), women's fear of competition (admissions into medical and law schools are highly competitive), or women's inability to excel in science (e.g., entry into medicine requires excellent achievement in the basic sciences). The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the role and/or impact a sense of belonging has inside and outside of STEM classrooms. Research questions focused on the role and/or impact of belonging contributes to students' self-efficacy beliefs as a STEM major. Bandura's self-efficacy theory serves as the theoretical framework. Data sources include close-ended surveys of 200 sophomore- and junior-level college students majoring in a STEM discipline. A quantitative exploratory approach allowed participants' responses to be analyzed using both correlation and multiple regression analyses to understand whether a student's sense of belonging is associated with his or her self-efficacy beliefs. Findings suggested that positive support systems impact students' self-efficacy and play a role in fostering students' motivation and decision to major in STEM disciplines. This study contributes to positive social change by providing empirical evidence faculty and administrators may use to promote university-based STEM support programs reflecting the impact belonging has on students' self-efficacy and potentially increasing the number of students majoring in STEM disciplines.","2012","2018-06-25 16:04:36","2018-06-25 16:04:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These attitudes play a critical role in math performance, math course-taking, and the pursuit of math-related career paths. We review existing research, primarily from U.S. samples, showing that parents' and teachers' expectancies for children's math competence are often gender-biased and can influence children's math attitudes and performance. We then propose three new directions for future research on the social transmission of gender-related math attitudes. First, parents' and teachers' own math anxieties and their beliefs about whether math ability is a stable trait may prove to be significant influences on children's math attitudes. Second, a developmental perspective that investigates math attitudes at younger ages and in relation to other aspects of gender development, such as gender rigidity, may yield new insights into the development of math attitudes. Third, investigating the specific behaviors and mannerisms that form the causal links between parents' and teachers' beliefs and children's math attitudes may lead to effective interventions to improve children's math attitudes from a young age. Such work will not only further our understanding of the relations between attitudes and performance, but will lead to the development of practical interventions for the home and classroom that ensure that all students are provided with opportunities to excel in math.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","","2018-06-25 16:04:36","2018-06-25 16:04:36","","153-166","","3-4","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study sought to expand upon these strategies by taking a group-based approach to reduce stereotype threat effects. Specifically, we investigated whether the success and numerical representation of women in STEM positively impacts women's math performance and affective reactions. We hypothesized that 1) women under threat (control) would perform worse than men; 2) there would be a larger performance difference for women than men when exposed to the success and balanced representation of women in STEM compared to the control condition; 3) there would be a larger performance difference for women than men between the balanced condition and the unbalanced condition where women are portrayed as successful, but not equally represented in STEM. For this study, male (n=56) and female (n=66) U.S. undergraduates from a large southern California state university read information about women's success and representation in STEM (or no information), completed a math exam under stereotype threat conditions, and then expressed their threat-based concerns. Results revealed that women performed worse than men in the control condition. Women in the balanced condition performed better than women in the control and unbalanced conditions. Men's performance was unaffected by the balance or imbalance of women in STEM. Women's affective reactions largely mirrored the performance results.

Remarkably, there is little evidence of a similar scale of concern or effort at redressing gender gaps in other professions. The question is why, as a society, we care so much about girls and women's representation in computing. The justification for trying to reduce the gender gap in computing has been largely driven by political, social, and economic concerns. My project takes issue with this basic premise and argues that the quest to solve the gender-computing gap must also be read as an ethical quest of far-reaching consequence regarding how we think about STEM fields in the 21st century. The contemporary gender-technology story is dependent on a number of transparent social-political-intellectual imaginaries and ill-defined concepts that circumscribe ethical, biological, ontological, and methodological explanations of the gender-technology relationship and its significance. These imaginaries and concepts are themselves grounded in a specifically modernist epistemology and relationship to technology, subjects, objects, and ethics that reflects values derived from the intersection of modern science and liberal humanism. This dissertation examines the bases of the gender technology story by analyzing documents culled from educational research and policy, national and international STEM agencies, and the popular (U.S.) press, all largely focused around computing. The thesis presents a new reading of the gender-technology story through intersecting lenses drawn from STS, feminist theory and technoscience, political and cultural theory, and philosophies of technology. Using this multi-faceted social discourse analysis, it argues several claims. First, the g/t story helps to constitute the problem it wants to solve. Second, methodological and epistemological beliefs, particularly surrounding objectivity and method, have made it seem prudent to focus on the gender-computing gap as a political problem of (in)equity. Third, the drive for a clear political-educational fix is a self-limiting quest. Fourth, in the story, gender and women are used as placeholders for this new ethic. Fifth, a culture that is overly skeptical of practices of ambiguity and complexity is a huge problem to overcome and limits progress towards the new ethical relationship to technology that the gender-technology story is trying to articulate. Framing the gender-technology relationship in largely political-epistemological terms has made it seem reasonable to believe that bringing more women into computing will bring about radical social change. However, just as many tenets of modernism are proving insufficient to the challenges emerging in the 21 st century (many the result of these values), so too, thinking about the gender-technology relationship (and problem) remains constrained by these same conceptual boundaries. I deconstruct the gender-technology story to reconstruct it as an expression of an emergent 21st century posthumanist desire for a new ethical relationship to technology and to the world.","2010","2018-06-25 16:04:37","2018-06-25 16:04:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the majority of the research addressing STEM issues is centered on increasing the pipeline, recruitment, and retention of underrepresented groups in the K-12 and collegiate domain. There is little, if any, literature focused on the career development of African American female engineers holistically. This is a critical missing link in the research which would support efforts to increase diversity in STEM. The purpose of this study was to provide this missing link by examining the career experiences of African American female engineers and exploring their challenges and support systems during their career development. This qualitative study was guided by the basic interpretive inquiry utilizing a life history approach. There were nine African American female participants in the study who currently work in an engineering field within an engineering industry. Data were obtained using in-depth interviewing where the participants were digitally recorded and the files were transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Using an ecological model to ground the study, the findings were categorized as macrosystem (environment) or microsystem (individual) factors. At the environmental level, the women utilized family support, teachers and counselors, university resources, pre-college programs, minority network, mentors, managerial support, and the company structure as systems of support. Conversely, in the macrosystem, the women were challenged by the limited representation, uncaring and unsupportive professors, unwelcoming peer network, lack of diversity in the workplace, and negative experiences due to their age, race, and gender. At an individual level, the participants relied on their self-image, determination, and perseverance to support their efforts in becoming engineers. On the other hand, microsystem challenges included lacking discipline and focus, experiencing difficulty seeking assistance, and adjusting to the program rigor. Overall, this research adds relevant information to understanding the experiences of African American women on their journey to engineering. In order to get more women of color in the engineering pipeline and continuing into the engineering workplace, the STEM community will need to examine the microsystem and macrosystem elements, as presented and address the pipeline holistically.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:37","2018-06-25 16:04:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 62 college graduates participated in telephone interviews that addressed gender differences in seven occupational values and three sources of social support. Results showed that differences in occupational values differ by both gender and between individuals in STEM and non-STEM careers. The strength of STEM values better predicted a career in STEM than did gender. Finally, women in STEM received the least amount of social support for their career pursuits. These results underscore the need to encourage women's interest in STEM, and develop interventions for career counselors that specifically address the unique needs of women in non-traditional careers.","","2018-06-25 16:04:37","2018-06-25 16:04:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The small number of women and underrepresented minorities (URM) earning doctoral degrees in STEM is particularly troubling given significant increases in the number of students earning master's degrees since 1990. In the decade between 1990 and 2000, the total number of master's recipients increased by 42%. During this same time period, the number of women earning master's degrees increased by 56%, African Americans increased by 132%, American Indians by 101%, Hispanics by 146%, and Asian Americans by 117% (Syverson, 2003). Growth in underrepresented group education at the master's level raises questions about the relationship between master's and doctoral education. Secondary data analysis of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) was used to examine institutional pathways to the doctorate in STEM disciplines and transitions from master's to doctoral programs by race and gender. While the study revealed no significant gender differences in pathways, compared to White and Asian American students, URM students take significantly different pathways to the doctorate. URM students are significantly more likely to earn the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees at three different institutions. Their path is significantly more likely to include earning a master's degree en route to the doctorate. Further, URM students are more likely to experience transition between the master's and doctoral degrees, and the transitions are not limited to those who earn master's degrees at master's-only institutions. These findings suggest that earning a master's degree is more often a stepping stone to the doctorate for URM students. Master's degree programs, therefore, have the potential to be a valuable resource for policymakers and graduate programs seeking to increase the diversity of URM students earning doctorates in STEM.","2006","2018-06-25 16:04:37","2018-06-25 16:04:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using an analysis method comprising elements of theories from Finnegan (2001), Kress & Van Leeuwen (1996), and Fahnestock ( 1999), the present study finds that images in three seventh-grade science textbooks are naturalistic or a combination of naturalistic and abstract, meaning they are easily accepted by viewers as realistic. Further, the study finds that these visuals argue enthymematically as a result of their realism, and that the arguments they make are repeated throughout entire texts. Many of the visual arguments made in these textbooks perpetuate endoxa of Western cultural gender stereotypes and thus are not positive for women and girls interested in pursuing STEM careers.","2012-11-27","2018-06-25 16:04:38","2018-06-25 16:04:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were two main purposes to understanding communicative aspects of stereotype threat: 1) the creation of a typology of stereotype threats received and 2) the elaboration of coping strategies used to mitigate threats. This research examined contextual factors that influence women’s coping, including socialization, psychological inoculations, and memorable messages. This work is a contribution to communication research as it examines these components through the lens of scripts, which considers stereotype threat from a new perspective that suggests people are active participants in mitigating threats. To complete this study, I performed 61 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with current or former female petroleum engineers. Through constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) I analyzed the data and produced an initial set of 13 different stereotype threats and 11 distinct coping strategies. Upon further comparison, the threats and coping strategies were each consolidated further to five core categories. This typology aligns threats on a spectrum that runs from passive actions to overt actions, and threats closely adhere to the underperformance benchmarks of previous stereotype threat research (Aronson & McGlone, 2009). The coping strategies address specific actions women take to mitigate threats, and the strategies align with the long-term responses to stereotype threat proposed by Block, Koch, Liberman, Merriweather, and Roberson (2011). In addition, the coping strategies execute problem- and emotion-based coping (Folkman and Lazarus, 1980). A distinctive feature of coping is dualistic subversions, which is when women use a subverted stereotype threat to mitigate it. Finally, this study suggests that stereotype threats and coping strategies result from childhood socialization practices, a process that writes scripts workers rely upon throughout their careers. This study is a contribution to organizational communication in how it examines ways messages are communicated in male-dominated careers and how women can use communication to mitigate negative expectations that arise in those environments. In addition, it looks at communication events that encourage women to enter male-dominated careers. Finally, it adds to communication theory because it uncovers additional ways that people use scripts to mitigate stereotyping.","2012-05","2018-06-25 16:04:38","2018-06-25 16:04:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discovering methods to keep female adolescents engaged in STEM: A phenomenological approach","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/docview/748170858","The decreasing number of women who are graduating in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields continues to be a major concern. Despite national support in the form of grants provided by National Science Foundation, National Center for Information and Technology and legislation passed such as the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that encourages women to enter the STEM fields, the number of women actually graduating in these fields is surprisingly low. This research study focuses on a robotics competition and its ability to engage female adolescents in STEM curricula. Data have been collected to help explain why young women are reticent to take technology or engineering type courses in high school and college. Factors that have been described include attitudes, parental support, social aspects, peer pressure, and lack of role models. Often these courses were thought to have masculine and “nerdy” overtones. The courses were usually majority male enrollments and appeared to be very competitive. With more female adolescents engaging in this type of competitive atmosphere, this study gathered information to discover what about the competition appealed to these young women. Focus groups were used to gather information from adolescent females who were participating in the First Lego League (FLL) and CEENBoT competitions. What enticed them to participate in a curriculum that data demonstrated many of their peers avoided? FLL and CEENBoT are robotics programs based on curricula that are taught in afterschool programs in non-formal environments. These programs culminate in a very large robotics competition. My research questions included: What are the factors that encouraged participants to participate in the robotics competition? What was the original enticement to the FLL and CEENBoT programs? What will make participants want to come back and what are the participants’ plans for the future? My research mirrored data of previous findings such as lack of role models, the need for parental support, social stigmatisms and peer pressure are still major factors that determine whether adolescent females seek out STEM activities. An interesting finding, which was an exception to previous findings, was these female adolescents enjoyed the challenge of the competition. The informal learning environments encouraged an atmosphere of social engagement and cooperative learning. Many volunteers that led the afterschool programs were women (role models) and a majority of parents showed support by accommodating an afterschool situation. The young women that were engaged in the competition noted it was a friendly competition, but they were all there to win. All who participated in the competition had a similar learning environment: competitive but cooperative. Further research is needed to determine if it is the learning environment that lures adolescent females to the program and entices them to continue in the STEM fields or if it is the competitive aspect of the culminating activity.","2010-01-01","2018-06-25 16:04:38","2018-06-25 16:04:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The persistence factors were examined through an analysis of university data and the use of a survey for enrolled senior standing students who declared their first major in engineering or math. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were utilized to collect and analyze data from the three sites. Factor analysis and logistic regression were used to analyze the quantitative data. The quantitative data retrieved from the survey instrument revealed that participants who were self motivated, felt they had a safe learning environment, and were engaged by the university were more likely to persist in engineering and math. Additionally, the survey revealed that race and ethnicity does not predict persistence of undergraduate women majoring in engineering and math. Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions revealed that the most important factor that helps female students persist in engineering and math major was self-confidence and determination. They also indicated that discrimination and stereotyping were the most difficult factors for female students to overcome. To enable more women to be successful in the pursuit of a engineering or math degree, participants made an overwhelming reference to intervention as student engagement. Student engagement consists of the following: outreach programs, support programs, study groups, homework sessions, women clubs, engineering or math clubs, math and sciences activities, math and science tours, engineering and math societies, educational programs focusing on engineering and math, online courses, women organizations in STEM, positive role models, female teachers, women mentors, exposure to engineering and math, and expanding the career outlooks of young women. They suggested that student engagement must start early and must be continuous throughout every level of the educational pathway and professional life. Recommendations are provided for policymakers and university administrators to continue supporting women majoring in EM and to increase awareness and access that encourage persistence of women in the pursuit of EM career goals.","2011","2018-06-25 16:04:38","2018-06-25 16:04:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While others studies have identified the reasons women leave engineering, this study focuses on women who persist in the profession. A complex, three stage mixed methods study has been conducted. The first stage was a qualitative research study based on semi-structured interviews with 31 women engineers, ten of whom had left an engineering career and 21 persisting for on average 21 years leading to a conceptual model and the development of a new construct to measure the ideal self. Next, a field experiment was conducted which surveyed 495 women ages 21 to 70 with engineering degrees. A structural equation model has been developed showing that womens commitment to an engineering career is impacted by their levels of self efficacy, the interaction of age and number of children, and their ability to articulate a personal vision as operationalized by the ideal self. A womans relationship with her manager and level of work engagement also impact career commitment. The final stage of this research compared the factors and relationships important to a womans career commitment to engineering to a sample of 138 male engineers. Findings show that the factors important to persistence for women engineers have little or no impact on a mans commitment to an engineering career. Women engineers have lower levels of self efficacy than men, and for men self efficacy has no statistically significant relationship to career commitment to engineering. Further both the relationship with the manager, ones ideal self, and work engagement influence a womans career commitment to engineering more than for a man. A conceptual model adapted from the intentional change theory (Boyatzis, 2008) is presented that integrates the findings from each of the studies to explain womens persistence in an engineering career. The model describes a womans persistence in engineering as a complex system where a recursive relationship exists between the dynamic of the ideal self and the real self or between ones dreams and ones reality.

Research suggests that racial, ethnic, class, and gender identity constructs impact students’ schooling experiences and academic achievement (Ayala, 2006; Akom, 2008; Bettie, 2003; Carter, 2006; Carter 2008; Connell, 1993; Finders, 1997; Fine, 1993; Fordham, 1993; Gallegos-Castillo, 2006; Hartman, 2006; Lopez, 2006; Matute-Bianchi, 2008; Mendoza-Denton, 2008; O’Connor, 2001; Romo, L.F., Kouyoumdjian, C., Nadeem, E., Sigman, M., 2006; Stevenson & Ellsworth, 1993; Weis, 1993; and Zentella, 1997). The implications of differential academic achievement reach far beyond the confines of K-12 schooling, impacting college graduation rates, fields of study and degree completion, and employment and pay opportunities (Landivar, 2013). The purpose of my investigation was to capture young Latinas’ understandings of their schooling experiences in order to explain the processes by which they became high- or low- achieving students, particularly in STEM related subjects such as 8th grade General Physical Science and Honors Science. The study focused on six middle school, 8th grade Latina students, their teachers, and parents to uncover what it meant for these girls to be successful and how recognition of certain social identities (Institution, Discourse, and Affinity) (Gee, 2000) mediated their academic achievement. Few studies have addressed differential academic achievement among middle school Latinas and none through the perspective of social identity theory (Burke and Stets, 2009; Gee, 2000; Jenkins, 2008). I utilized qualitative research methods, including observations and interviews, to gather data to inform this study. Themes were determined based on repetitive instances of specific dialogue and behaviors of girls enacting, and others recognizing, social identities that could be viewed with the identity lens as outlined by Gee (2000) and Burke and Stets (2009). I found that Honors AVID Latinas and General AVID Latinas achieved different academic outcomes due to enacted behaviors and recognition of those behaviors. Honors AVID Latinas intentionally negotiated academic behaviors associated with recognition as serious students, which meant being present and future goal-oriented. How parents, teachers, and peers recognized Honors AVID Latinas as serious students hinged on the work involved in maintaining this multifaceted social identity. General AVID Latinas enacted behaviors associated with recognition as good students and good girls, which meant doing well in school, being well behaved, and being future oriented. Their parents, however, privileged social behavior over academics and, therefore, recognized their daughters’ enactments of good student as good girl performances. Through this recognition, the two groups of girls achieved different academic outcomes.","2015","2018-06-25 16:04:39","2018-06-25 16:04:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vocational interest and goal affordance ratings (having a positive social impact, family, and occupation status) for occupations characterized as working with people or things were assessed in 1848 students (42% female; 81% white non-Hispanic) majoring in biology (gender balanced), non-biology STEM (male-dominated), and female-dominated health fields. Participant PO and TO interests were also collected. Results indicated that non-biology STEM majors showed lower PO and higher TO interests than biology and health majors. Non-biology STEM majors also endorsed PO and TO interests at similar levels, but the other two major groups indicated higher PO than TO. People Jobs were perceived to more likely afford goals related to family and positive social impact; whereas Thing Jobs were perceived to more likely afford status goals. Interest in People Jobs was similar for women in both STEM major groups. Female non-biology STEM majors were equally interested in People and Thing Jobs; whereas biology majors preferred People Jobs. PO, TO, and goal affordance ratings independently predicted interest in People and Thing Jobs, and gender accounted for very little additional variance.

Data are from the NLSY79, and our analysis focuses on members of this cohort who received a college degree, with an emphasis on those who completed a degree in a STEM field. Our analyses test the extent to which college major, expectations to work in STEM, and family expectations shaped transitions into STEM occupations within two years of degree completion. Among those majoring in STEM fields there were no gender differences in transitioning into STEM jobs, though there were sizable differences in transitions to STEM employment by field of study. Of note are gender differences in associations between family expectations and transitions into STEM employment. The most career oriented women, who expected to marry late and limit fertility, were no more likely to enter STEM jobs than were women who anticipated marrying young and having two or more children. The men most likely to enter STEM occupations, in contrast, adhered to significantly more conventional gender ideologies than their female counterparts, expecting to marry at younger ages but also to remain childless. Results of our regression decomposition indicated that marriage and family expectations and gender ideology worked in opposite directions for men and women.

Stigma consciousness (in the form of awareness of sexism and negative attitudes about women), but not stereotype vulnerability, negatively related to women's confidence in their abilities to complete a college degree in a engineering major field. Results of a moderation model indicated a significant interaction of CWB and stigma consciousness on academic self-efficacy, with no such interaction effect for stereotype vulnerability. Our findings add to the proximal contextual barriers framework within Social Cognitive Career Theory by uncovering the existence of negative relationships between consciousness of discrimination due to group identity and academic self-efficacy.

In this paradigm, 2-year graduates transfer as online students into the Distance Education in MCS (DE MCS) bachelor of science program. The program has broadened access to STEM with a steadily increasing enrollment that does not draw students away from existing on-campus programs. Notably, half of the DE MCS students are from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds and two-thirds are women, which represents a greater level of diversity than the corresponding on-campus cohort and the entire university. Additionally, the DE MCS cohort has comparable retention and academic performance compared with the on-campus transfer cohort. Of those who have earned a BS through the DE MCS program, 71% are women and 61% are URM. Overall, these data demonstrate that the hybrid online approach is successful in increasing diversity and provides another viable route in the myriad of STEM pathways. As the first of its kind in a STEM field, the DE MCS program serves as a model for programs seeking to broaden their reach.","2016-09-21","2018-06-25 16:04:43","2018-06-25 16:04:43","","1-10","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyses also examine the different comparative advantages men and women enjoy in math/science versus English/reading. Regardless of how prior achievement is measured, very little of the strong and persistent gender gap in physical science and engineering majors over time is explained. Findings highlight the limitations of theories focusing on gender differences in skills and suggest directions for future research.

It examines the trajectory of learning that takes students from A‐level qualifications, through undergraduate work and into employment or further study. It also uses a long‐term view to look at the best available evidence to monitor participation and attainment over an extended period of time. The findings suggest that almost three decades of initiatives to increase participation in STEM subjects have had little noticeable impact on the recruitment data and gendered patterns of participation persist in several subject areas. This is despite more women entering HE and little gender difference in the entry qualifications for STEM subjects. While more women are studying science, as broadly conceived, than ever before, recruitment to key areas, namely physics and engineering remains stagnant. However, for those women who do remain in the ‘science stream’ patterns of employment in graduate careers and further study appear relatively equitable.

What remains unclear is whether female and male researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) disciplines differ in their collaboration propensity. Here, we report on an empirical analysis of the complete publication records of 3,980 faculty members in six STEM disciplines at select U.S. research universities. We find that female faculty have significantly fewer distinct co-authors over their careers than males, but that this difference can be fully accounted for by females’ lower publication rate and shorter career lengths. Next, we find that female scientists have a lower probability of repeating previous co-authors than males, an intriguing result because prior research shows that teams involving new collaborations produce work with higher impact. Finally, we find evidence for gender segregation in some sub-disciplines in molecular biology, in particular in genomics where we find female faculty to be clearly under-represented.

Based on previous research and framework development in human information behavior, the Distributed Information Behavior System was designed to assess the social practice of information identification, gathering, and use. In this study, flight crews were used as the test bed. The goal of this research was to assess if different information behaviors are practiced by accident-involved crews and crews not involved in an accident. The results indicate that differences indeed exist in the way crews identify, gather, and use information based on their performance level. This study discerns that high performing crews practice substantially different information behaviors than low performing and accident-involved crews. This work serves as a way to understand the social practice of information structuring within high reliability operations. Subsequently, this may aid researchers to identify the role sequencing plays in critical information negotiation. This work also serves as a tool to inform training and is applicable to other domains where work is supported through distributed collective practice.","2008","2018-06-25 16:05:07","2018-06-25 16:05:07","","1555-1569","","10","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from 1994 through 2011 from all 99 state legislative chambers, the linear regression models used in this study control for external factors including the characteristics of each legislature, statewide socioeconomic variables, and geographic regions. Previous studies have not shown that term limits increase the number of women in the legislature. However, this paper allows the effect of term limits to differ between upper and lower chambers and conclusively demonstrates that term limits significantly increase the percentage of women serving in state senates. This finding is further bolstered by the use of a fixed effects model, which also shows that term limits are associated with a statistically significant increase in the percentage of women in upper legislative chambers. These results are important because upper chambers have fewer women on average than lower chambers. When women comprise fewer than 15 percent of a legislature, they are affected by the dynamics of tokenism, wherein underrepresented members adopt the behavioral norms of the majority group. When women exceed 15 percent of a legislature, however, they exhibit different legislative behavior than their male counterparts. The increase in women caused by term limits helps reduce tokenism in state senates and allows female legislators to legislate as they see fit.","2011","2018-06-25 16:05:07","2018-06-25 16:05:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several theories of formative assessment exist, all which propound the importance of feedback to the student. The theories discussed include a three-strand approach based on learning outcomes, student involvement, and feedback; a framework based upon shared learning expectations, questioning, feedback, self-assessment, and peer assessment, and the ideas of assessment of learning, assessment for learning, and assessment as learning. Methodologies of formative classroom assessment range from traditional methods research in the early 1990's to technology enabled methods such as blogs and classroom response systems. Implementation of the formative assessment techniques at Holy Family University involved a Classroom Assessment Support Group which led the efforts. The facilitators of the group presented basic methodology, and the members of the group supported each other's efforts to implement assessment techniques in their courses. Five techniques were found appropriate for the project management course, and three were implemented. The methodology, results, and recommendations indicate that formative assessment techniques are beneficial in a project management course, but care needs to be taken to implement properly in order for the assessment to be formative.

The entire seventh-grade class from a Midwest junior high school was used in the study. Each student was randomly assigned into one of four treatment groups: (1) color-cued presentation, color-cued assessment; (2) color-cued presentation, black/white assessment; (3) black/white presentation, color-cued assessment; (4) black/white presentation, black/white assessment. During their homeroom session, all students received directions via audiotape; they then, in isolation, read and studied the graphic presentation summarizing a little-known Norse myth. Finally, they demonstrated both immediate recall and two week delayed retention on the graphic assessment without the aid of the presentation graphic. By reviewing the mean performance at recall and retention as a function of the type of presentation graphic, it was determined that the preferred presentation type was color-cued. There was one major finding of the study: the important factor in enhancing performance appeared to be the presence of a systematic color cue in graphic presentation. (Contains 15 references.)

The study finds 34 variables to be significant. These variables including factors that have not often been studied, such as distance from the library, age/school attendance status, use of other types of library, and public library expenditure per state capita. It is also worth noting that disadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and people with disabilities, were less likely to use public libraries. This was true even after other factors such as education and income were held constant. The study provides a national-level assessment of the under-served populations.

While Kanter argued that performance pressures, social isolation, and role encapsulation were the consequences of disproportionate numbers of women and men in a workplace, a review of empirical data concludes that these outcomes occur only for token women in gender-inappropriate occupations. Furthermore, Kanter's emphasis on number balancing as a social-change strategy failed to anticipate backlash from dominants. Blalock's theory of intrusiveness suggests that surges in the number of lower-status members threaten dominants, thereby increasing gender discrimination in the forms of sexual harassment, wage inequities, and limited opportunities for promotion. Although Kanter's analysis of the individual consequences of tokenism was compelling to researchers and organizational change agents, continued reliance on numbers as the theoretical cause of, and as the solution to, gender discrimination in the workplace neglects the complexities of gender integration.","1991","2018-06-25 16:05:09","2018-06-25 16:05:09","","178-192","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The students' lower than expected results subsequently encouraged greater skill development. However, not all students elected to undertake the first quiz. A final assessable information literacy quiz increased the levels of student engagement, suggesting that skill development activities need to be made assessable.

A project in which students receive information literacy instruction and then proceed to select, update, and write about a current research topic in an upper-level cell biology course is described. Students research the chosen topic using paper and electronic resources, generate a list of relevant articles, prepare abstracts based on papers read, and, finally, prepare a“ state-of-the-art” paper on the topic. This approach, which extends over most of one semester, has resulted in a number of well-researched and well-written papers that incorporate some of the latest research in cell biology.

The study was conducted at Monash University in the four undergraduate ICT degrees of the Faculty of Information Technology. The study draws on data collected from staff and students using interviews and a start of semester survey. Three aspects of engagement broadly classified as behavioural, cognitive and affective are used as a framework to analyse the data. Results show that staff perceived students as demonstrating low levels of engagement in their university study. Students presented many reasons to explain the nature and extent of their engagement. Many of their reasons relate to studying in an educational landscape of changing lifestyles and work patterns and a strong reliance on technology to support their learning. This article re-conceptualises the undergraduate student learning experience in the current tertiary climate. Implications of the perceived lack of student engagement are discussed and recommendations are made for ways to increase the level of student engagement.

Our exploration of the math-gender gap in the United States led us to a description of the types of questions on the SAT-M and GRE-M and gender differences in responses to these question types. We found that the math test we had been using in our studies with Chinese college students did not contain the types of questions that favored men. We constructed a new math test containing these types of questions and replicated our stereotype threat experiment using Chinese physics majors. Once again we found no evidence of stereotype threat and no gender differences. We first discuss these results in terms of political, societal, and educational differences between China and the United States that could preclude gender differences in math performance and the disruptive effects of stereotype threat, then focus on limits to the generality and potency of the phenomenon of stereotype threat itself.

"KFRG8Z75","thesis","2010","Woody, Abby May","Tectonic geomorphology of the Puna Tsang Chhu Valley, western Bhutan","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/612709916?accountid=14692","There are two boundaries, or physiographic transitions, between three distinct topographic regions in Bhutan. The southern and northern regions have relatively steep hillslopes and high relief, while the central region has gentle hillslopes and low relief. The geomorphology of a 70-km stretch along the Puna Tsang Chhu valley between the towns of Uma and Amrimo was studied in March and April of 2009 to provide constraints on the active tectonics of western Bhutan and the nature of these physiographic transitions. The Puna Tsang Chhu valley contains a set of alluvial cut-and-fill and bedrock (strath) river terraces with associated sediments - younger than ca. 18.8 ka - that record a prolonged history of aggradation - ca. 7.5 mm/yr - and incision - ca. 7.7 mm/yr - in response to climatic changes and surface uplift. The presence of preserved geologic markers, particularly river terraces that are younger than ca. 10.4 ka, makes this valley an ideal candidate for tectonic geomorphology research. Methods used in order to investigate the physiographic transitions in the Puna Tsang Chuu valley include: geologic field mapping, surveying, OSL geochronology, and quantitative geomorphic modeling. Geologic observations are incorporated with the geochronology control to investigate the cut-and-fill history, uplift rates, and temporal uplift patterns along the Puna Tsang Chhu. This research suggests that these physiographic transitions are tectonic in nature. Observations associated with the northern physiographic transition (PT2a) include a steep, concave river profile, an increase in relief to the north, a fluvial knickpoint, and an increase in terrace riser height to the north. Evidence for an active fault at PT2a includes abrupt changes in modern stream length-gradient ( SL ), slope gradient (S ), and area of relief (Ar ) indices. The SL and S indices, calculated for paleo-river profiles defined by retro-deformed fluvial terrace profiles, indicate that activity at PT2a is steady. The fault at PT2a could be the Kakhtang Thrust (KT) because the KT is close to PT2a and both have the same trend. PT2b may be caused by recent activity along a ramp on the Main Central Thrust (MCT) rather than the surface trace of an active fault. Observations associated with PT2b include: a steep, convex river profile, an increase in relief to the south, a fluvial knickpoint, a gradual increase in surface uplift to the south, and an increase in terrace riser heights to the south. The results of the SL, S , and Ar analyses suggest that recent, yet diminishing tectonic activity formed PT2b. The recent, out-of-sequence thrust activity along the KT and MCT suggests that exhumation of the GHS as the leading edge of an intracrustal channel may be an ongoing process in the Bhutan Himalaya.","2010","2018-06-25 16:05:10","2018-06-25 16:05:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even after controlling for other factors, Blacks and Hispanics (Black and Hispanic men, in particular) were significantly underrepresented in online courses, women were significantly overrepresented, and students with non-traditional student risk factors (delayed enrollment, no high school diploma, part-time enrollment, financially independent, have dependents, single-parent status, and working full-time) were significantly more likely to enroll online. However, although ethnicity, gender, and non-traditional factors were all important predictors for both 2- and 4-year STEM majors, at community colleges, ethnicity and gender were more important predictors of online enrollment than non-traditional characteristics, which is the opposite pattern observed at 4-year colleges.

Authors have posited that this may stem from inadequate academic identity development of women at the doctoral level. While gender differences may be explained by multiple and variable factors, mentoring has been proposed as a viable means to promote academic identity development and address these gender gaps. A “StartingDoc program” was launched and supported by four universities in French-speaking Switzerland. The purpose of this paper is to report the experience of one of the six “many-to-one” mentoring groups involved in the StartingDoc program in 2012-2013. Design/methodology/approach: – This study is based on the description of a group experience within a university-based mentoring scheme offered to women entering in their PhD program in French-speaking Switzerland. It is examined using a qualitative, narrative case study design. Findings: – Themes from the narrative analysis included the four dimensions of the Clutterbuck model of mentoring (guiding, coaching, counselling, networking), as well as an additional five emerging themes: first expectations, process, sharing, building identity, and unmet expectations. The qualitative analyses suggest that mentoring can be an effective tool in supporting professional identity development among female doctoral students. However, further work is needed to elucidate the most effective strategies for developing and retaining women in academia. Originality/value: – While a many-to-one mentoring group has been theorized and is recognized as an effective means of supporting doctoral experience, its implementation in French-speaking Switzerland is in its infancy. This study provides insights into the value of such a mentoring scheme dedicated to women at the very beginning of their doctoral studies. Most notably it created opportunities for mentees to: discover aspects of academic life; break isolation; and develop some of the soft skills required to facilitate their doctoral journey.","2015","2018-06-25 16:05:11","2018-06-25 16:05:11","","37-52","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Tarun</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It considers and rejects resource-based and utilitarian approaches to well-being and opts for Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capabilities approach which involves developing graduates' capabilities and functionings to be and do in ways which they have reason to value. The capabilities approach argues for educational and social development as the expansion of such freedoms. The approach is sensitive also to diversity through the focus on the choice of a plurality of functionings and a wide informational basis for policy, practice and social justice evaluations. It allows an analysis of how different individuals can convert available resources into functionings through attending to conversion factors: personal (internal) conversion factors, social conversion factors and environmental (external) conversion factors. All make a difference to how an individual converts her resources into functionings and makes advantage and disadvantage visible. There is a further education-specific issue, that of selecting core valuable capabilities because not any form of science and engineering education will do. Educators need to deliberate and agree which capabilities and corresponding functionings are valuable and so should be supported in policy and practice. In a capabilities-friendly education, education would aim to secure and distribute valuable education capabilities to diverse students (women and men, black and white, rural and urban and so on) paying attention to the social arrangements in education (pedagogies, institutional culture and education policy) and to conversion factors and barriers that might impede the development of opportunities and valued outcomes.

The theoretical framework draws from post-structural feminism, queer theory, and gender performance theory. This is summarized in the gender oppression plane, in which one axis measures gender category privilege or oppression, and the other axis measures gender conformity privilege or gender transgression oppression. Feminism addresses the former axis, and queer theory addresses the latter axis. Gender performativity theory helps to explain an individual's placement on the plane, and how that placement can change with time or context.

This is not limited to young first-time graduates but continues and evolves throughout the life course. Mature women students, who are returning after career breaks, face a number of barriers in re-entering such employment sectors. Drawing on data from a longitudinal study of women graduates in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, who participated in a UK government-funded online programme aimed at supporting them to return to work, the paper examines three gendered factors identified as being of particular influence on outcomes – gender role normativity, locality and mobility, and structural and institutional barriers. The paper concludes by identifying strategies deployed by those that successfully returned to employment, including retraining, networking and doing unpaid or low-paid work.

This article takes a realistic look at the “STEM problem,” identifying how community colleges can be a part of the solution. We provide evidence that shortages in STEM workers vary by geographic locale. Furthermore, STEM achievement is not consistent across ethnic groups or between men and women. These gaps may be due to unequal access to STEM degree programs and the shortage of quality STEM teachers.

This paper draws on narrative interviews with feminist women to consider the importance of education to their experience of becoming feminist. It considers how, for a particular group of women who were all students or recent graduates of non-STEM disciplines, academic feminism formed an important part of their narrative of becoming feminist. Each of the women referred to having a long-standing feminist inclination, instinct or feeling and indicated that studying academic feminism offered them the tools for reflecting on and articulating this.

Institutions of higher education, therefore, and the government agencies providing them with support hope to increase women's participation, status, and opportunities for career advancement in these fields. When surveyed, female faculty members indicate that they are interested in receiving various sorts of support for career development. The related literature, moreover, suggests that mentoring programs are among the successful strategies for providing such support. The literature also acknowledges that mentoring of female faculty, especially in the STEM fields, must address their unique needs, cultural barriers in general, and specific institutional barriers. Both traditional and nontraditional approaches offer promise. The National Science Foundation's ADVANCE program supports a variety of programs, many using mentoring models, to expand career opportunities for female faculty members in STEM fields. This chapter describes several mentoring programs for women STEM faculty, including those at Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, and the University of Miami. It also describes more extensive efforts to address the career advancement interests of female faculty, particularly those who aspire to leadership positions.

However, subsequent post-high school study of the participants showed that interest in engineering was not enough for lower-income minority women to pursue engineering in college. It should be noted that their decision against pursuing engineering in college was not due to their lack of academic preparation or interest in the field, but to a lack of financial resources and social support for engineering, as well as fears of failure. Career counselors and college recruiters have an important role to play in the recruitment and retention of girls of color in engineering and other STEM college majors, including facilitating support and access to appropriate programs and resources at pivotal times.

We study the effects of one such affirmative action program: an admissions policy that fixes percentage quotas, common across more than 200 engineering colleges, for disadvantaged castes and for women. We show that the program increases college attendance of targeted students, particularly at relatively higher-quality institutions. An important concern is that affirmative action might harm intended beneficiaries by placing them in academic programs for which they are ill-prepared. We find no evidence of such adverse impacts.

Traditionally, universities have considered AP enrollment as an indicator for predicting academic success during the admission process. However, AP exam performance may be predictive of future academic success; a related factor in gender differences in major selection and success; and instrumental in predicting STEM persistence. Purpose: This study focused on determining the influence of patterns of AP exam completion and performance on indicators of post-secondary academic achievement. These patterns were examined in the context of gender differences and for the prediction of grades, STEM persistence and graduation rates. Subjects: The sample consisted of 26,693 students who entered the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) as first-year undergraduate students during the period of 1999-2009. Research Design-Archival admissions records and college transcripts were obtained for entering first-year (non-transfer) students, to examine patterns of AP exams completed and performance on the exams, as they related to indicators of college academic performance, inflow and outflow STEM majors and non-STEM majors, and attrition/time-to-degree criteria. For predicting college performance, patterns of AP exams were examined in isolation, exams grouped by domain, and instances of multiple examinations completed (e.g., three or more AP exams in the STEM area). These patterns of AP exams were evaluated for predictive validity in conjunction with traditional predictors of post-secondary performance (e.g., high-school GPA and SAT scores). College course enrollment patterns were also examined, in conjunction with AP exam patterns, to determine the associations between AP exam performance and course-taking patterns in post-secondary study. Data Collection and Analysis: Admissions records were obtained from Georgia Tech, including high-school grade point average information, along with college transcripts, including initial and final major declaration, attrition, and graduation data. Course enrollments were classified by level and by domain. Advanced Placement exam and SAT records were obtained from the College Board, and matched to the Georgia Tech records. Conclusions/Recommendations: Although student completion of AP exams was positively related to post-secondary grades and graduation rates, this overall pattern masks the relation between AP exam performance and post-secondary success. Students who did not receive credit tended to perform at a level similar to those students who did not complete any AP exams. Increasing numbers of AP-based course credits were associated with higher GPAs at Georgia Tech for the first year and beyond. Students with greater numbers of AP-based course credits termed to complete fewer lower-level courses and a greater number of higher-level courses. Such students graduated at a substantially higher rate and in fewer semesters of study. Average AP exam score was the single best predictor of academic success after high school GPA (HSGPA). The mast important predictors of STEM major persistence were receiving credit for AP Calculus and if the student had successfully completed three or more AP exams in the STEM areas. Men had substantially higher rates of these AP exam patterns, compared to women. Given that slightly over half of the AP exams are now completed by high school students prior to their senior year, it is recommended that admissions committees consider use of actual AP exam performance data, in addition to, or instead of AP enrollment data as indicators for predicting post-secondary academic performance.

To help maintain this advantage, the federal government has spent billions of dollars on education programs in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields for many years. However, concerns have been raised about the nation's ability to maintain its global technological competitive advantage in the future. This testimony is based on our October 2005 report and presents information on (1) trends in degree attainment in STEM- and non-STEM-related fields and factors that may influence these trends, (2) trends in the levels of employment in STEM- and non-STEM- related fields and factors that may influence these trends, and (3) federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in STEM-related fields. For this report, we analyzed survey responses from 13 civilian federal departments and agencies; analyzed data from the Departments of Education and Labor; interviewed educators, federal agency officials, and representatives from education associations and organizations; and interviewed students. While postsecondary enrollment has increased over the past decade, the proportion of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields has fallen. In academic year 1994-1995, about 519,000 students (32 percent) obtained STEM degrees. About 578,000 students obtained STEM degrees in academic year 2003-2004, accounting for 27 percent of degrees awarded. Despite increases in enrollment and degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level, the number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several STEM-related fields from academic year 1994-1995 to academic year 2003-2004. College and university officials and students most often cited subpar teacher quality and poor high school preparation as factors that discouraged the pursuit of STEM degrees. Suggestions to encourage more enrollment in STEM fields include increased outreach and mentoring. The past decade has seen an increase in STEM employees, particularly in mathematics and computer science. From 1994 to 2003, employment in STEM fields increased by an estimated 23 percent, compared to 17 percent in non-STEM fields. Mathematics and computer science showed the highest increase in STEM-related employment, and employment in science-related fields increased as well. However, in certain STEM fields, including engineering, the number of employees did not increase significantly. Further, while the estimated number of women, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans employed in STEM fields increased, women and minorities remained underrepresented relative to their numbers in the civilian labor force. The number of foreign workers employed in the United States has fluctuated, experiencing declines in 2002 and 2003. Key factors affecting STEM employment decisions include mentoring for women and minorities and opportunities abroad for foreign employees. Thirteen federal civilian...

Research has identified implicit gender-bias as a major barrier to women's progression in these fields. Previous research using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) suggests that individuals studying or working in STEM fields exhibit different levels of implicit male-STEM bias than those in non-STEM fields. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a non-relative measure, was compared with the IAT which allowed us to probe this difference further among STEM and non-STEM students. The IRAP revealed a more detailed and complex picture of gender-STEM bias. All groups demonstrated a significant implicit pro-male-STEM bias. However, there was also evidence of a pro-female-STEM bias, significant only among female STEM students. A number of correlations were observed between the explicit measure and the IRAP. The presence of a pro-female-STEM bias has implications for the development of interventions. If this relational response can become more normative it may influence attitudes and behavior towards women in STEM.","2017","2018-06-25 16:14:24","2018-06-25 16:14:24","","80-90","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that essentially randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures.

Among those who believed it is legitimate for men to represent STEM, men's prototypicality threat mediated the relationship between perceptions that more women were entering their field and resistance toward this change (i.e., opposing women in STEM initiatives, wanting women to conform to the field's traditional norms, and expressing exclusionary intentions toward women peers).

Gender gaps begin early; young girls report less interest and self-efficacy in technology compared with boys in elementary school. In the current study (N = 96), we assessed 6-year-old children’s stereotypes about STEM fields and tested an intervention to develop girls’ STEM motivation despite these stereotypes. First-grade children held stereotypes that boys were better than girls at robotics and programming but did not hold these stereotypes about math and science. Girls with stronger stereotypes about robotics and programming reported lower interest and self-efficacy in these domains. We experimentally tested whether positive experience with programming robots would lead to greater interest and self-efficacy among girls despite these stereotypes. Children were randomly assigned either to a treatment group that was given experience in programming a robot using a smartphone or to control groups (no activity or other activity). Girls given programming experience reported higher technology interest and self-efficacy compared with girls without this experience and did not exhibit a significant gender gap relative to boys’ interest and self-efficacy. These findings show that children’s views mirror current American cultural messages about who excels at computer science and engineering and show the benefit of providing young girls with chances to experience technological activities.","2017","2018-06-25 16:14:24","2018-06-25 16:14:24","","92-106","","","160","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although descriptive statistics show that a smaller percentage of women and minorities persist in a STEM field major as compared to male and non-minority students, regression analysis shows that differences in preparation and the educational experiences of these students explains much of the differences in persistence rates.

A higher percentage of female and minority STEM field graduate students positively impacts on the persistence of female and minority students. However, there is little evidence that having a larger percentage of STEM field faculty members that are female increases the likelihood of persistence for women in STEM majors.

The reasons for this difference are complex, and one possible contributing factor is the social environment women experience in the classroom. Using social network analysis, we explore how gender influences the confidence that college-level biology students have in each other's mastery of biology. Results reveal that males are more likely than females to be named by peers as being knowledgeable about the course content. This effect increases as the term progresses, and persists even after controlling for class performance and outspokenness. The bias in nominations is specifically due to males over-nominating their male peers relative to their performance. The over-nomination of male peers is commensurate with an overestimation of male grades by 0.57 points on a 4 point grade scale, indicating a strong male bias among males when assessing their classmates. Females, in contrast, nominated equitably based on student performance rather than gender, suggesting they lacked gender biases in filling out these surveys. These trends persist across eleven surveys taken in three different iterations of the same Biology course. In every class, the most renowned students are always male. This favoring of males by peers could influence student self-confidence, and thus persistence in this STEM discipline.","2016-02-10","2018-06-25 16:14:25","2018-06-25 16:14:25","","e0148405","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chairs prove more committed to family friendly policies if departments embrace a diversity strategy. Those aspiring to move up in the administrative hierarchy are more likely to champion policies of unpaid family leave, spousal hiring assistance and workload reduction for family reasons, whereas female chairs advocate more of family leave and onsite childcare policies.

We study the impact of identity processes related to being a science student on entering a science occupation. More broadly, we examine whether an identity formulated in one institutional setting (education) has effects that persist to another institutional setting (the economy). We find that the science identity positively impacts the likelihood of entering a science occupation. It also serves as a mediator for other factors that are related to educational success.

First, individuals may particularly value communal goals (e.g., working with or helping others), due to either chronic individual differences or the salience of these goals in particular contexts. Second, individuals hold beliefs about the activities that facilitate or impede these goals, or goal affordance stereotypes. Women's tendency to endorse communal goals more highly than do men, along with consensual stereotypes that STEM careers impede communal goals, intersect to produce disinterest in STEM careers. We provide evidence for the foundational predictions that gender differences emerge primarily on communal rather than agentic goals (Studies la and 3) and that goal affordance stereotypes reflect beliefs that STEM careers are relatively dissociated from communal goals (Studies 1b and 1c). Most critically, we provide causal evidence that activated communal goals decrease interest in STEM fields (Study 2) and that the potential for a STEM career to afford communal goals elicits greater positivity (Study 3). These studies thus provide a novel demonstration that understanding communal goals and goal affordance stereotypes can lend insight into attitudes toward STEM pursuits.","2011-11","2018-06-25 16:14:25","2018-06-25 16:14:25","","902-918","","5","101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that gender differences in college major selection remain substantial, even for a cohort in which rates of enrollment in postsecondary education are more than ten percent higher for young women than for young men. Consistent with other recent research, we demonstrate that neither gender differences in work-family goals nor in academic preparation explain a substantial portion of these differences. However, the occupational plans of high school seniors are strong predictors of initial college major selection, a finding that is revealed only when occupational plans are measured with sufficient detail, here by using the verbatim responses of students. We also find that the association between occupational plans and college major selection is not attributable to work-family orientation or academic preparation. Finally, we find gender differences in the associations between occupational plans and college major selection that are consistent with prior research on STEM attrition, as well as with the claim that attrition also affects the selection of majors that are gateways into doctoral-track medicine. We discuss the implications of the predictive power of occupational plans formed in adolescence for understanding sex segregation and for policies intended to create a gender-balanced STEM and doctoral-level medical workforce.

Specifically, utilizing longitudinal data from a diverse sample of adolescent youth, analyses examine how the presence of biased male peers, as well as confident female peers, shape girls' subsequent intentions to pursue different STEM fields, focusing specifically on intentions to pursue the male-dominated fields of computer science and engineering, as well as more gender equitable fields. Results reveal that exposure to a higher percentage of 8th grade male peers in the classroom who endorsed explicit gender/STEM stereotypes significantly and negatively predicted girls' later intentions to pursue a computer science/engineering (CS/E) major. Yet results also reveal that exposure to a higher percentage of confident female peers in the science classroom positively predicted such intentions. These results were specific to CS/E majors, suggesting that peers are an important source of messages regarding whether or not girls should pursue non-traditional STEM fields. This study calls attention to the importance of examining both positive and negative sources of influence within the local contexts where young people live and learn. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.","2017-03-15","2018-06-25 16:14:26","2018-06-25 16:14:26","","329","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using both administrative data and four separate longitudinal studies sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), we evaluate several prominent explanations for the persisting gender gap in STEM fields related to mathematics performance and background and general life goals, and find that none of them are empirically satisfactory. Instead, we suggest that the structure of majors and their linkages to professional training and careers may combine with gender differences in educational goals to influence the persisting gender gap in STEM fields. An analysis of gendered career aspirations, course-taking patterns, and pathways to medical and law school supports this explanation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Within this policy and program environment, researchers have focused considerable attention on improving STEM education at different stages of the educational pipeline, yet we lack evidence on how resources from one educational setting may influence outcomes in a successive educational setting. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus: The purpose of the study is to examine individual-and school-level factors that influence students' pathways to the STEM fields during college. Focusing on the importance of high school-to-college linkages, our research questions address the individual and institutional factors that affect students' likelihoods of majoring in a STEM field in college. Research Design: The study is based on data collected through the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, a nationally representative survey of high school sophomores who were followed through high school and into college. Students who were enrolled in a four-year institution at the end of 2006 and had declared a major were included in the analytic sample. Analysis: In addition to performing descriptive and factor analyses, we used cross-classified hierarchical general linear modeling to examine students' backgrounds, aptitudes, attitudes, dispositions, and experiences in relation to majoring in a STEM field, as well as institutional factors that constitute students' secondary and postsecondary environments. Findings/Conclusions: Findings from the study revealed significant effects in relation to race, academic preparation, attitudes and dispositions toward math and science, college choice considerations, and postsecondary experiences. Although no institutional effects were uncovered at the high school level, both postsecondary sector and selectivity significantly influenced propensities toward majoring in a STEM discipline. The study concludes with several policy recommendations related to K-16 collaborations, dual-enrollment programs, and developmental considerations for teachers and counselors working with high school students.","2013-01","2018-06-25 16:14:27","2018-06-25 16:14:27","","010304","","1","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our review of pertinent literature and independent analysis of data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 finds that the trajectory implied by the pipeline metaphor fails to describe the experience for nearly half of those who go on to become scientists or engineers, masks meaningful differences in trajectories by subfield, and informs policies that do little to diversify or increase the size of the STEM workforce.

These barriers reinforce the stereotype that women's gender is incompatible with their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field, and can interfere with their sense of belonging and self-efficacy within STEM. The present work expands this literature in two ways, by 1) focusing on a distinct period in women's careers that has been relatively understudied, but represents a critical period when career decisions are made, that is, graduate school; and 2) highlighting the buffering effect of one critical mechanism against barriers to STEM persistence, that is, perceived support from advisors. Results of the present study show that perceived support from one's advisor may promote STEM engagement among women by predicting greater gender-STEM identity compatibility, which in turn predicts greater STEM importance among women (but not men). STEM importance further predicts higher sense of belonging in STEM for both men and women and increased STEM self-efficacy for women. Finally, we describe the implications of this work for educational policy.","2016-09-01","2018-06-25 16:14:27","2019-10-23 13:37:00","","ar45","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important reason for this disparity is that girls are less likely than boys to enroll in necessary ""pipeline courses,"" such as introductory computer science. Two experiments investigated whether high-school girls' lower interest than boys in enrolling in computer science courses is influenced by stereotypes of the field. We further tested whether these stereotypes can be communicated by the physical classroom environment, and whether changing this environment alters girls' interest. In 2 experiments (N = 269), a computer science classroom that did not project current computer science stereotypes caused girls, but not boys, to express more interest in taking computer science than a classroom that made these stereotypes salient. The gender difference was mediated by girls' lower sense of belonging in the course, even beyond the effects of negative stereotype concerns, expectations of success, and utility value. Girls' lower sense of belonging could be traced to lower feelings of fit with computer science stereotypes. Individual differences in fit with stereotypes predicted girls' belonging and interest in a stereotypical, but not a nonstereotypical, classroom. Adolescence is a critical time for career aspirations. Girls may avoid computer science courses because current prevailing stereotypes of the field signal to them that they do not belong. However, providing them with an educational environment that does not fit current computer science stereotypes increases their interest in computer science courses and could provide grounds for interventions to help reduce gender disparities in computer science enrollment.","2016-04","2018-06-25 16:14:28","2018-06-25 16:14:28","","424-437","","3","108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sixteen women of color who were undergraduates majoring in a science field participated in three-part, in-depth interviews. Prominent factors associated with persistence as a science major included academic preparation for college science, faculty support, important school science experiences, family support, science support programs, altruistic beliefs, and the importance of religion. This study examined the data using current persistence theories as well as exploring the role of cultural and social capital as sources for support and motivation.","2016-01","2018-06-25 16:14:28","2018-06-25 16:14:28","","S186","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional measures of high-school grade point average and high-stakes entrance examinations are valid predictors, especially of 1st-year college grades, yet a large amount of individual-differences variance remains unaccounted for. Studies of individual trait measures (e.g., personality, self-concept, motivation) have supported the potential for broad predictors of academic success, but integration across these approaches has been challenging. The current study tracks 589 undergraduates from their 1st semester through attrition or graduation (up to 8 years beyond their first semester). Based on an integrative trait-complex approach to assessment of cognitive, affective, and conative traits, patterns of facilitative and impeding roles in predicting academic success were predicted. We report on the validity of these broad trait complexes for predicting academic success (grades and attrition rates) in isolation and in the context of traditional predictors and indicators of domain knowledge (Advanced Placement [AP] exams). We also examine gender differences and trait complex by gender interactions for predicting college success and persistence in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Inclusion of trait-complex composite scores and average AP exam scores raised the prediction variance accounted for in college grades to 37%, a marked improvement over traditional prediction measures. Math/Science Self-Concept and Mastery/Organization trait complex profiles were also found to differ between men and women who had initial STEM major intentions but who left STEM for non-STEM majors. Implications for improving selection and identification of students at-risk for attrition are discussed.","2013-08","2018-06-25 16:14:29","2018-06-25 16:14:29","","911-927","","3","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about how self-confidence in science, mathematics, and engineering courses (STEM confidence) varies at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender. To fill this gap, this study examined the STEM confidence of multiple groups in undergraduate engineering programs. Results indicated that although some underrepresented groups may have lower STEM confidence overall, this finding no longer applies to all groups after controlling for personal, environmental, and behavioral factors. Specifically, African-American and Hispanic men report higher average STEM confidence than White men after controlling for these associated measures. In addition, White women continue to report lower average STEM confidence than White men after controlling for these measures, while other groups do not differ from White men. Further, many elements of student perception, including student views of professors, comparisons to peers, perceptions of the field as rewarding, and desirability of chosen major are positively associated with student STEM confidence. The changing patterns of significance for race/ethnicity and gender groups between the two models indicate that personal, environmental, and behavioral factors have different relationships with STEM confidence levels for different groups. This study contributes an understanding that gender differences in STEM confidence are not indifferent to racial and ethnic context. Social-cognitive theory provides a valuable framework for studying student academic confidence and would improve future self-confidence research.","2014-12","2018-06-25 16:14:29","2018-10-26 16:28:54","","810-832","","8","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3TFLPJXN\Litzler et al. - 2014 - Breaking it Down Engineering Student STEM Confide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first demonstrate the perceived difficulty of finding role models who enact communal behaviors in STEM relative to other fields (Preliminary Study). Communally oriented students reported higher likelihood of observing admired others in math or science (i.e., investigative vicarious learning) over time (Study 1). Individuals preferred hypothetical STEM advisors who enacted communal workplace behaviors (Studies 2a-2b).

Similarly, professional advice and support networks are important to understanding the advancement of scientific careers. This research aims to marry these two lines of research to investigate and compare the ways in which men and women scientists seek advice and support from women in their networks. Using a sample of academic scientists in nonmedical biology, chemistry, computer science, earth and atmospheric sciences, electrical engineering, and physics we assess the extent to which women and men scientists seek advice and support from women in their networks. We find that field of science is the primary predictor for the presence of women in scientists' advice and support networks. We also find that citizenship, rank, age, and friendship are significantly related to the proportion of women in women's networks, but are not consistently significantly related to the proportion of women in men's networks.

To explore the current causes of women's under-representation in biology, we collected publicly accessible data from university directories and faculty websites about the composition of biology laboratories at leading academic institutions in the United States. We found that male faculty members tended to employ fewer female graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (postdocs) than female faculty members did. Furthermore, elite male faculty-those whose research was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, who had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, or who had won a major career award-trained significantly fewer women than other male faculty members. In contrast, elite female faculty did not exhibit a gender bias in employment patterns. New assistant professors at the institutions that we surveyed were largely comprised of postdoctoral researchers from these prominent laboratories, and correspondingly, the laboratories that produced assistant professors had an overabundance of male postdocs. Thus, one cause of the leaky pipeline in biomedical research may be the exclusion of women, or their self-selected absence, from certain high-achieving laboratories.","2014-07-15","2018-06-25 16:14:29","2018-06-25 16:14:29","","10107-10112","","28","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The masculine culture of science is thought to be inconsistent with occupational values associated with feminine personalities, and to create a discriminatory academic environment for those who cannot adapt to it. However, there has been little systematic investigation into the extent to which masculine and feminine personality characteristics are actually correlated with STEM career outcomes, or how the effects of masculine and feminine personality characteristics on STEM career outcomes may be different when embodied in women compared to men. This study tests several hypotheses concerning the relationship of masculine and feminine personality characteristics to occupational values, perceptions of academic climate, and selection of a STEM major in college among a sample of 752 students enrolled at a major public university. We find little support for the hypothesis that masculine personality characteristics are especially rewarded in STEM majors. However, we also find that women pay a femininity penalty in STEM majors, while more abundant feminine personality traits in men render them more likely to major in a STEM field, after accounting for occupational values. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the author investigates whether the gendered relationship between family attitudes and STEM attainment changed during a period characterized by shifting ideas about gender, as well as increasing opportunities for women. In the 1970s, family attitudes negatively affected only women's STEM intentions and attainments. This study presents the novel finding that by the 1990s, both family-oriented young women and men were less likely to intend to major in STEM fields. Still, women who placed high priority on family had lower STEM attainments than similarly family-oriented men in the 1990s, even after controlling for STEM intentions.

Participants were students entering a selective university engineering program. The social-belonging intervention aimed to protect students' sense of belonging in engineering by providing a nonthreatening narrative with which to interpret instances of adversity. The affirmation-training intervention aimed to help students manage stress that can arise from social marginalization by incorporating diverse aspects of their self-identity in their daily academic lives. As expected, gender differences and intervention effects were concentrated in male-dominated majors (<20% women). In these majors, compared with control conditions, both interventions raised women's school-reported engineering grade-point-average (GPA) over the full academic year, eliminating gender differences. Both also led women to view daily adversities as more manageable and improved women's academic attitudes. However, the 2 interventions had divergent effects on women's social experiences. The social-belonging intervention helped women integrate into engineering, for instance, increasing friendships with male engineers. Affirmation-training helped women develop external resources, deepening their identification with their gender group. The results highlight how social marginalization contributes to gender inequality in quantitative fields and 2 potential remedies.

In Study 1, a questionnaire study, male undergraduates were more interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors than were female undergraduates, and this gender disparity was mediated by women anticipating having less power in STEM fields than men did. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that a lack of female representation within an academic context (MBA program) led women to infer that they would lack power in that context.

Recently, it has been suggested that some of these gender gaps no longer exist; however, the picture is more nuanced, for women are represented well in some STEM fields (such as biology) and not in others (such as computer science). The current research employed survey methodology to explore the perceptions of 360 finalists and semifinalists of the prestigious Science Talent Search. Two cohorts of participants who were either in their late 30s (Cohort 2) or late 20s (Cohort 1) were contacted to investigate factors that influenced them to select or not select STEM college majors and occupations. Comparisons between men and women revealed that women recalled having lower self-efficacy in STEM in college than men, and fewer women selected STEM majors as undergraduates. Interest was cited as a major influence for occupational selection for both men and women. Proportionally, more women than men entered fields such as biology and fewer women entered fields such as engineering and physics/astronomy. A greater proportion of older women mentioned leaving STEM because of a lack of flexible hours and needing to attend to family responsibilities.

The intervention was implemented in introductory psychology (Study 1,N = 258) and chemistry (Study 2,N = 68) courses. Relative to the control group, the intervention group had higher grades and lower failing and withdrawal rates.

Goal theory provides a useful framework from which to understand issues of underrepresentation. We followed a large sample of high-achieving African American and Latino undergraduates in STEM disciplines attending 38 institutions of higher education in the United States over 3 academic years. We report on the science-related environmental factors and person factors that influence the longitudinal regulation of goal orientations. Further, we examine how goal orientations in turn influence distal academic outcomes such as performance and persistence in STEM. Using SEM-based parallel process latent growth curve modeling, we found that (a) engagement in undergraduate research was the only factor that buffered underrepresented students against an increase in performance-avoidance goals over time; (b) growth in scientific self-identity exhibited a strong positive effect on growth in task and performance-approach goals over time; (c) only task goals positively influenced students' cumulative grade point average, over and above baseline grade point average; and (d) performance-avoidance goals predicted student attrition from the STEM pipeline. We discuss the implications of these findings for underrepresented students in STEM disciplines.

In comparison with students who entered the social sciences or humanities, STEM students demonstrated higher competencies in mathematics and placed more importance on pursuing investigative activities. Qualitative analysis revealed that learning experiences, parental support, and role models were decisive in terms of the female students’ choice of studies.

S. women continue to shun certain STEM fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This study investigates this question and examines the pathways that women and men follow in attaining their STEM bachelor's degrees. Methods Using NELS 88-00 and the postsecondary transcript data, the descriptive analysis examines gender differences in the three stages of the STEM pipeline: expected college major, first major, and bachelor degree major. The multivariate analysis examines the outcomes of STEM degree attainment, the subfields attainment and the pathways in a series of logical steps. Results Drawing from the pipeline model and its associated cumulative disadvantage theory, and the alternative framework of revolving door theory, analyses from this study indicate that men are more likely than women to follow the complete persistence pathway to attain STEM degrees, but women are as persistent as men once they expect a major in STEM as high school seniors. High school achievement, attitudes, and course taking are related to the subfields attainment, as well as the pathways of the STEM degree attainment. Conclusions Taken together, the results are more aligned with revolving door theory and support the contextual variability in the salience of gender to understand gender differences in attaining STEM fields.

However, there is a dearth of literature on this topic. This article advances our understanding of the nature of these challenges by analyzing career–life balance issues for three underrepresented minority women and the impact of these issues on their career trajectories. We explore the experiences of these women, at different stages of pursuing STEM academia, as they encounter career–life balance issues. Using the approach of narrative inquiry, we describe the interplay between domestic realities (e.g., social life, elder care, pregnancy) and the ideal worker norm, a prevalent gendered standard within STEM of pure dedication to scientific work. Using the lens of cumulative disadvantage we examine how the intersection of racial/ethnic and gender identities generated a set of experiences for each participant that positioned her outside that norm, resulting in significant obstacles (e.g., exclusion from professional networks, lack of support, questioning of competence). We describe how continual tension with the ideal worker norm impacted these women’s career trajectories, illustrate how their experiences of career–life balance may be different from those who more closely embody the norm, and detail issues that need to be addressed to increase the participation, retention, and advancement of women of color in STEM academia.

Eighty photos (half women) of tenured/tenure-track science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty at elite research universities were selected from the Internet. Participants, naïve to the targets' occupations, rated the photos on femininity and likelihood of being a scientist and an early childhood educator. Linear mixed model analysis treated both participants and stimuli as random factors, enabling generalization to other samples of participants and other samples of stimuli. Feminine appearance affected career judgments for female scientists (with increasing femininity decreasing the perceived likelihood of being a scientist and increasing the perceived likelihood of being an early childhood educator), but had no effect on judgments of male scientists. Study 2 replicated these findings with several key procedural modifications: the presentation of the stimuli was manipulated to either be blocked by gender or completely randomized, questions pertaining to the stimuli's appearance were removed, and a third career judgment likelihood rating was added to avoid tradeoffs between scientist and early childhood educator. In both studies, results suggest that for women pursuing STEM, feminine appearance may erroneously signal that they are not well suited for science.

Using a recent nationally representative sample of college graduates, this study examines educational aspiration of college graduates in STEM majors and focuses on gender-based differences in the pursuit of advanced degrees in order to better understand the factors underlying the underrepresentation of women in their low-participation disciplines. Multinomial logit analysis is conducted to identify the factors that contribute to educational aspirations, graduate school application, and gender-based differences therein. The major findings are that (1) educational aspiration is a strong and important mediator to college graduates' pursuit of continuing education; (2) female students are more sensitive to socio-psychological influences from significant others in developing educational aspirations; (3) given the aspiration for graduate education, women's applications to graduate school is influenced strongly by family and financial factors.

University students ( N = 223) enrolled in biology, chemistry, physics, and psychology courses participated in the study. Mastery approach, mastery avoidance, and performance avoidance achievement goals were hypothesized to moderate the effect of stereotype threat on academic procrastination. Results indicated significant interactions for women but not for men; however, interactions were not in the hypothesized direction for the avoidance goal moderators. Mastery approach goals exerted a significant buffering effect on the stereotype threat-academic procrastination relationship, but, contrary to prediction, both mastery avoidance and performance avoidance goals exerted a significant buffering effect.

The culture of engineering departments and negative stereotypes of women's engineering and mathematical ability have been identified as factors that inhibit women's entry into engineering and cause them to leave the major. Even for women who stay, stereotype threat or the anxiety of confirming a negative stereotype can decrease academic performance. To more fully understand this dynamic, we examined four factors associated with stereotype threat (engineering identification, gender identification, gender stereotype endorsement, and engineering ability perceptions) to determine how they impacted women's achievement and persistence in engineering at the end of their first year of an engineering program. Participants included 363 first-year general engineering students from a large public university. Students completed a questionnaire near the end of their first year. Results indicated that there were differences between men and women for gender stereotype endorsement and engineering ability perceptions, with men more likely to hold negative stereotypes of women's engineering abilities and women more likely to report higher perceptions of their engineering abilities. Engineering identification was a significant predictor of persistence in engineering, and engineering ability perceptions were significant predictors of achievement; the relationships were stronger for women than men. The fact that neither gender identification nor gender stereotype endorsement were related to achievement or persistence in engineering indicated that they were less important factors for first-year women engineering students than engineering identification and engineering ability perceptions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:32","2018-06-25 16:14:32","","471-493","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less attention has focused on experimentally testing solutions to this problem. We report an experiment investigating one solution: we created “microenvironments” (small groups) in engineering with varying proportions of women to identify which environment increases motivation and participation, and whether outcomes depend on students’ academic stage. Female engineering students were randomly assigned to one of three engineering groups of varying sex composition: 75% women, 50% women, or 25% women. For first-years, group composition had a large effect: women in female-majority and sex-parity groups felt less anxious than women in female-minority groups. However, among advanced students, sex composition had no effect on anxiety. Importantly, group composition significantly affected verbal participation, regardless of women’s academic seniority: women participated more in female-majority groups than sex-parity or female-minority groups. Additionally, when assigned to female-minority groups, women who harbored implicit masculine stereotypes about engineering reported less confidence and engineering career aspirations. However, in sex-parity and female-majority groups, confidence and career aspirations remained high regardless of implicit stereotypes. These data suggest that creating small groups with high proportions of women in otherwise male-dominated fields is one way to keep women engaged and aspiring toward engineering careers. Although sex parity works sometimes, it is insufficient to boost women’s verbal participation in group work, which often affects learning and mastery. Significance Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are critical to the American economy and require a robust workforce. The scarcity of women in this workforce is a well-recognized problem, but data-driven solutions to this problem are less common. We provide experimental evidence showing that gender composition of small groups in engineering has a substantial impact on undergraduate women’s persistence. Women participate more actively in engineering groups when members are mostly female vs. mostly male or in equal gender proportions. Women feel less anxious in female-majority groups vs. minority groups, especially as first-year students. Gender-parity groups are less effective than female-majority groups in promoting verbal participation. Female peers protect women’s confidence and engineering career aspirations despite masculine stereotypes about engineering.","","2018-06-25 16:14:32","2018-06-25 16:14:32","","4988-4993","","16","112","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such perceptions might disproportionately affect women's career decisions, because women tend to endorse communal goals more than men. As predicted, we found that STEM careers, relative to other careers, were perceived to impede communal goals. Moreover, communal-goal endorsement negatively predicted interest in STEM careers, even when controlling for past experience and self-efficacy in science and mathematics.

This qualitative study examines the formative, professional, and personal experiences of twelve black women who have obtained their doctoral degrees in mathematics. Black feminist thought inquiry was used as the theoretical framework and a grounded-theory approach was used to analyze the data. Through these women's experiences, informal and formal avenues of exposure such as family influence, informal dialogue, and attending historically black colleges and universities emerged as factors for their success in becoming a mathematician.

However, the proportion of earned degrees for women in some of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses continues to lag behind male baccalaureate completions (National Science Foundation, 2010). In addition, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), only 21% of information and computer science degrees were awarded to women in 2006 (NCWIT, 2007). In the past decade, higher education has experienced a rapid decline in the number of women involved in the information sciences, particularly computer science (Bank, 2007). A number of social and educational factors have been considered barriers to women entering STEM fields and this area has been well studied in the literature. However, research examining the relationship between gender differences and learning styles in the context of these technical fields is limited. According to Kolb (1976), people decide on a major based on how well the norms of the major fit with their individual learning styles. This paper presents gender differences in learning styles and recommends teaching methodologies most preferred for female learners in STEM courses.

However, the mechanisms through which single-sex programs increase women's engagement in STEM fields are unclear. Drawing from research in social and health psychology, we examined two theoretically-guided predictors of women's sense of belonging in their STEM majors and belonging at the university: perceived identity compatibility between being a woman and being in a STEM field, and perceived social support. Participants were 65 racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse women enrolled in a single-sex STEM program at a co-educational university in Northeastern United States. Participants completed online surveys before the start of their first year of college, and again at the beginning of their second year of college. Findings from multiple regression analyses support hypotheses that across STEM women's first or transitional year of college, perceived identity compatibility, perceived support from close others, and perceived support from the single-sex program for STEM women were each independently associated with greater sense of belonging in their major. Additionally, perceived identity compatibility and perceived support from the single-sex program were associated with greater sense of belonging at the university. These findings suggest that perceived support from sources such as single-sex programs and perceived compatibility between one's field and being female may sustain women pursuing training in nontraditional fields such as STEM. Continued investigation of these factors may elucidate the impact of single-sex programs and inform interventions to increase the retention of women in STEM.

To facilitate retention, career counselors, instructors, and others may assist students to frame challenge as normal among persisting STEM upperclassmen.","","2018-06-25 16:14:34","2018-06-25 16:14:34","","348-362","","4","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Legitimacy beliefs served as a risk factor for both women from ethnic groups that are overrepresented in STEM (e.g., Asian Americans and European Americans) and from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM (African Americans and Latina Americans), albeit under different conditions. Among women from overrepresented ethnic groups, legitimacy beliefs were negatively related to test performance when explicit cues to sexism were present.

In the first set of analyses, I examined whether the prevalence of self-reported gender bias varied depending on the educational context. I then examined whether experiencing gender bias was associated with lower STEM self-concept and, if so, whether having a supportive network of STEM peers would buffer this effect. Data were collected through a self-report survey that was administered to high school girls who aspired to have STEM careers, women in STEM undergraduate majors, and women in STEM doctoral programs. Overall, 61% of participants reported experiencing gender bias in the past year, but the prevalence rate varied according to their phase of education and field of study. In particular, women in math-intensive undergraduate majors were especially likely to encounter gender bias, which predominately originated from male peers in their major. As expected, participants who encountered gender bias had lower STEM self-concept than participants who did not. However, this effect was attenuated for participants who also had a supportive network of STEM peers. These findings suggest that positive peer connections may be a valuable resource for girls and women in the STEM pipeline.

Although a number of studies of women in STEM have examined the importance of the communal goal of helping others, few studies have examined another communal goal, maintaining a romantic relationship. To address this gap, we designed a two-part study to explore the impact of romantic relationships on relationship and career goals of college STEM majors. First, a survey was conducted that examined the impact of relationship status on 713 male and 409 female college STEM majors' life goals and gender roles (82 % White). Although results indicated gender differences in goals and roles related to family and careers, interaction effects with relationship status that would suggest unique negative impacts on women's education or career goals were not found. Next, a subsample of 59 female STEM majors (81 % White) and their male romantic partners participated in a study examining their investments in and beliefs about careers, family, and the balance between the two. Findings suggest that successful female STEM majors may seek and find partners who are supportive of their educational and careers goals, as evidenced by the partners' investment and expectations for relationship and work roles. Overall, findings indicate that a supportive romantic partner may be a positive determining factor for women's success in STEM.","","2018-06-25 16:14:34","2018-06-25 16:14:34","","110-125","","3-4","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of growth in women's engineering degree attainment continues despite initiatives to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students in engineering. The peer networks found in ""STEM intervention programs"" (SIPs)–supplemental programs offered by colleges and universities to attract, retain, and support traditionally underrepresented students–may serve as a critical source of social support and may encourage a sense of belonging for female students, including women of color who experience cultural incongruence in STEM (Tate & Linn, 2005).

We argue that women might expect to feel less good in contexts where unfavorable gender stereotypes are activated in their minds (e.g., by strong underrepresentation) and, consequently, are less likely to aspire to STEM careers. In two pilot studies (Ns=28/61), we confirmed that undergraduate women expect more negative and less positive affect (i.e., generally (un)pleasant emotions) and a heightened sense of threat in a stereotype-activating, compared to a not stereotype-activating, test scenario. In Study 1 (N=102), the scenario indirectly lowered college women's STEM career aspiration (adjusted for preliminary domain identification) due to lower anticipated positive affect, but not to higher negative affect, in the stereotype-activating scenario. The scenario had no detrimental effect on college men's anticipated affect or their career aspirations. In Study 2, 91 high school students reported anticipated affect and self-efficacy in different university majors and their intentions to choose the subject as a major. The more stereotypically male (in terms of gender distribution) the subject, the more negative and the less positive was young women's, but not young men's, anticipated affect. Only lower positive, but not higher negative, affect predicted low study intentions over and above self-efficacy. To increase women's aspirations, their expected feelings in STEM deserve attention. One approach to foster positive affect might be to create less stereotypical STEM contexts.","","2018-06-25 16:14:35","2018-06-25 16:14:35","","40-55","","1-2","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By comparison at Stevenson University (SU), 71% of the full-time STEM faculty members are female and 100% of the academic leadership in STEM is provided by women, which sets the university apart from the national norm. Together with an informed, innovative approach to curriculum reform, synergistic leadership and management principles and practices have allowed the School of the Sciences (SOS) at SU to do more with less in STEM education. Total enrollment in the SOS has grown dramatically in recent years and now represents 29% of the total full-time undergraduate population. Local and national STEM outreach programs led by the SOS serve to complement the undergraduate programs and to strengthen the STEM workforce and education pipelines at multiple points. By sharing strategies and results in a case study format, this paper will demonstrate a model for ""what works"" with regard to female leaders building and sustaining successful and effective academic programs in STEM. An important element of the model is the mentoring web that has been developed to support and sustain the leaders, faculty, staff, and students in the SOS. The SOS network includes both formal and informal structures in which one-on-one and group mentoring occurs on a regular basis. The nature of the mentoring is tailored to the position of the participants involved, but in each case the mentoring contributes to professional growth and development. The emphasis on mentoring has contributed to an increased sense of community and collegiality in the SOS and has enabled the School of the Sciences to make rapid progress in STEM curricular reform and program improvement.

Some researchers did not describe the racial and ethnic composition of their samples, even if only to note that all of the participants were white women, or simply chose not to examine racial and ethnic differences in the design of the study. Ignoring race and ethnicity obscures important dimensions of women's experiences in STEM and fosters the notion of a universal gender experience among women, without considering the differential experiences of women of color or the effects of racial privilege for white women. Women of color should not be further marginalized in a body of research that, in theory, is about transforming women's underrepresentation in male-dominated academic disciplines and career fields. This article provides an overview of how women of color are represented in higher education as undergraduate and graduate students and faculty.

Underrepresentation of women in STEM in the United States has economic consequences, both individually and nationally. For example, given the ongoing connection between individuals' technological skills and their economic opportunities, women's economic independence may be hindered by underparticipating in the technological industries of the twenty-first century. Further, in light of the national call to action for research in science and technology, women's underrepresentation in STEM signifies a loss of potential talent and innovation that may have an impact on the ability of the United States to remain globally competitive in science and engineering. The technological and scientific professional workforce stands to benefit from diverse perspectives. Creating opportunities for more women to enter and be successful in STEM fields will contribute to diversifying STEM perspectives, ultimately making scientific research more vigorous and complete. Given that women's underrepresentation in the STEM workforce is largely rooted in their selection of college major, this article summarizes the factors that contribute to women's selection of and persistence in STEM majors. The authors begin with a review of how the educational context shapes women's interest in STEM, and then they move to an overview of the major social and cultural influences beyond the classroom.

Women in the welcoming environment received more messages about women in STEM, were more likely to wear or carry markers of their major, and had more peer role models in STEM. In Study 2, we developed an intervention based on these factors to improve women's implicit beliefs about their participation in STEM.

Thus, growing evidence revealing a gender bias against women – or favoring men – within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) settings is provocative and raises questions about the extent to which gender bias may contribute to women's underrepresentation within STEM fields. To the extent that research illustrating gender bias in STEM is viewed as convincing, the culture of science can begin to address the bias. However, are men and women equally receptive to this type of experimental evidence? This question was tested with three randomized, double-blind experiments – two involving samples from the general public (n = 205 and 303, respectively) and one involving a sample of university STEM and non-STEM faculty (n = 205). In all experiments, participants read an actual journal abstract reporting gender bias in a STEM context (or an altered abstract reporting no gender bias in experiment 3) and evaluated the overall quality of the research. Results across experiments showed that men evaluate the gender-bias research less favorably than women, and, of concern, this gender difference was especially prominent among STEM faculty (experiment 2). These results suggest a relative reluctance among men, especially faculty men within STEM, to accept evidence of gender biases in STEM. This finding is problematic because broadening the participation of underrepresented people in STEM, including women, necessarily requires a widespread willingness (particularly by those in the majority) to acknowledge that bias exists before transformation is possible.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:35","2019-10-23 13:47:32","","13201","","43","112","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent reports have shown that biomedical sciences (BMS) graduate students become less interested in faculty careers as training progresses; however, it is unclear whether or how the career preferences of women and underrepresented minority (URM) scientists change in manners distinct from their better-represented peers. We report results from a survey of 1500 recent American BMS Ph.D. graduates (including 276 URMs) that examined career preferences over the course of their graduate training experiences. On average, scientists from all social backgrounds showed significantly decreased interest in faculty careers at research universities, and significantly increased interest in non-research careers at Ph.D. completion relative to entry. However, group differences emerged in overall levels of interest (at Ph.D. entry and completion), and the magnitude of change in interest in these careers. Multiple logistic regression showed that when controlling for career pathway interest at Ph.D. entry, first-author publication rate, faculty support, research self-efficacy, and graduate training experiences, differences in career pathway interest between social identity groups persisted. All groups were less likely than men from well-represented (WR) racial/ethnic backgrounds to report high interest in faculty careers at research-intensive universities (URM men: OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36-0.98, p = 0.04; WR women: OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89, p = 0.008; URM women: OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30-0.71, p<0.001), and URM women were more likely than all other groups to report high interest in non-research careers (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.90, p = 0.002). The persistence of disparities in the career interests of Ph.D. recipients suggests that a supply-side (or ""pipeline"") framing of biomedical workforce diversity challenges may limit the effectiveness of efforts to attract and retain the best and most diverse workforce. We propose incorporation of an ecological perspective of career development when considering strategies to enhance the biomedical workforce and professoriate through diversity.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:36","2018-06-25 16:14:36","","e114736","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 25493425","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In health and biological sciences, for example, women's representation among U.S. scientists is now on par with or greater than men's, while in physical sciences and engineering they remain a clear minority. We investigated whether variation in proportions of women in scientific disciplines is related to differing levels of male-favoring explicit or implicit stereotypes held by students and scientists in each discipline. We hypothesized that science-is-male stereotypes would be weaker in disciplines where women are better represented. This prediction was tested with a sample of 176,935 college-educated participants (70% female), including thousands of engineers, physicians, and scientists. The prediction was supported for the explicit stereotype, but not for the implicit stereotype. Implicit stereotype strength did not correspond with disciplines' gender ratios, but, rather, correlated with two indicators of disciplines' scientific intensity, positively for men and negatively for women. From age 18 on, women who majored or worked in disciplines perceived as more scientific had substantially weaker science-is-male stereotypes than did men in the same disciplines, with gender differences larger than 0.8 standard deviations in the most scientifically-perceived disciplines. Further, particularly for women, differences in the strength of implicit stereotypes across scientific disciplines corresponded with the strength of scientific values held by women in the disciplines. These results are discussed in the context of dual process theory of mental operation and balanced identity theory. The findings point to the need for longitudinal study of the factors' affecting development of adults' and, especially, children's implicit gender stereotypes and scientific identity.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:36","2018-06-25 16:14:36","","415","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 25964765","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Computer science and engineering are stereotyped in modern American culture as male-oriented fields that involve social isolation, an intense focus on machinery, and inborn brilliance. These stereotypes are compatible with qualities that are typically more valued in men than women in American culture. As a result, when computer science and engineering stereotypes are salient, girls report less interest in these fields than their male peers. However, altering these stereotypes-by broadening the representation of the people who do this work, the work itself, and the environments in which it occurs-significantly increases girls' sense of belonging and interest in the field. Academic stereotypes thus serve as gatekeepers, driving girls away from certain fields and constraining their learning opportunities and career aspirations.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:36","2018-06-25 16:14:36","","49","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 25717308","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used retrospective longitudinal methods to investigate how accurately this ""leaky pipeline"" metaphor has described the bachelor's to Ph.D. transition in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the U.S. since the 1970s. Among STEM bachelor's degree earners in the 1970s and 1980s, women were less likely than men to later earn a STEM Ph.D. However, this gender difference closed in the 1990s. Qualitatively similar trends were found across STEM disciplines. The leaky pipeline metaphor therefore partially explains historical gender differences in the U.S., but no longer describes current gender differences in the bachelor's to Ph.D. transition in STEM. The results help constrain theories about women's underrepresentation in STEM. Overall, these results point to the need to understand gender differences at the bachelor's level and below to understand women's representation in STEM at the Ph.D. level and above. Consistent with trends at the bachelor's level, women's representation at the Ph.D. level has been recently declining for the first time in over 40 years.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:37","2018-06-25 16:14:37","","1-10","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 25741293","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When encountering this threat, what might allow women to protect themselves against it? This dissertation investigates how manipulating the visual perspective (own 1st-person vs. observer's 3rd-person) used to visualize a past success could inoculate women against stereotype threat. First, I outline how stereotype threat occurs, detailing how information about the ingroup (i.e., women), the ability (i.e., math skills), and the self combines in order to create a fear of confirming the negative stereotype against one's group. Then, I outline a model of visual imagery perspective, arguing that third-person (vs. first-person) imagery can facilitate processing where people integrate the imagined event with their broader sense of self. Therefore, I argue that visualizing a past math success from the third-person (vs. first-person) perspective can protect women against stereotype threat by connecting the success with their broad sense of self, thereby allowing them to perform as well as if they had encountered no stereotype threat. Next, I describe the method and results of two experiments that show support for the idea that third-person (vs. first-person) imagery can protect women against stereotype threat in the context of STEM skills. The first experiment takes place in a naturally-occurring math classroom, while the second experiment controls for more environmental factors by taking place in a psychology laboratory. Both experiments manipulate the visual imagery perspective (first- vs. third-person) used to imagine a past math success before encountering a math test, which is manipulated to be framed as provoking stereotype threat or not, which is then measured for performance. The results of both experiments are discussed in detail, along with recommendations for future research to clarify the results of these two studies. Finally, I integrate the results of the present research with existing theories and findings in stereotype threat and imagery perspective, then describe potential applications for these findings in order to help improve the performance and experience of women in STEM.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:37","2018-06-25 16:14:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines ways in which these students sense that their belonging and competence in science are questioned because their bodies do not conform to prevalent images of the ""ordinary"" white male physicist. To persevere in physics, they engage in bodily projects of (1) approximating ordinariness through fragmentation, which entails using strategies of racial or gendered ""passing,"" or (2) rejecting these practices in favor of multiplicity, which entails employing stereotype manipulation or performances of superiority.

Although the research is geographically localized, the base-line question is clear and mirrors in the researcher's own intellectual development: ""How do Black women physicists describe their experiences towards the construction of a scientific identity and the pursuit of a career in physics?"" Grounded on a critical race theory perspective, the study uses storytelling to analyze how these women build their identities as scientists and how they have negotiate their multiple identities within different communities in society. Findings show that social integration is a key element for Black women physicists to enter study groups, which enables access to important resources for academic success in STEM. The study has implications for physics education and policymakers.

The purpose was to understand those experiences that contributed to their success at Purdue, with success defined as being retained for further study at the university. Four research questions guided this study: (1) Using learning community participation as a lens, how do female STEM majors perceive their collegiate experience? (2) To what extent and in what ways did learning community participation influence academic and/or social integration? (3) What barriers did female STEM students have to overcome in order to be successful (with success meaning retained)? and (4) What characteristics or knowledge do successful female STEM majors possess and how were those characteristics developed or knowledge learned? A qualitative design called an unfolding matrix (Padilla, 1991, 1994, 1999-2000, 2009) was employed. Students were invited to participate in interviews, whereupon a specific protocol was used. A matrix was completed during each interview. Each subsequent participant was able to see and comment on previous participants' experiences, and then provide their own experiences for consideration. In all, the seven women listed and described 52 distinct experiences or sets of experiences they believed contributed to their success at Purdue University. The matrix completed during the interviews served as the data set for analysis. Five assertions emerged from the analysis of the data: (1) Learning communities aid female students in becoming academically and socially integrated to Purdue University; (2) Female students must develop a sense of personal awareness in order to succeed; (3) The transition to and through college comes with a need for female students to learn how to learn on their own, develop intrinsic motivation, and become more independent in general; (4) students must develop good academic behavior sets in order to succeed, and these must be tailored to their individual strengths and abilities; and, (5) Female students must actively seek out and engage with other successful women in their majors, colleges, or fields.","2009","2018-06-25 16:14:37","2018-06-25 16:14:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a collective case study of six graduate departments, and an in-depth case study of one department, the researcher highlights six characteristics of these mathematics departments and their descriptive elements. The participants are a collection of Directors of Graduate programs, graduate students, and faculty members. Graduate students from all six departments participated in an open-ended on-line questionnaire about their experiences and perceptions of the graduate mathematics department within their respective university. Directors of Graduate programs, graduate students, and faculty members participated in qualitative interviews. Further data was collected from the departmental and university websites. The theoretical framework is the Communities of Practice work (Wenger, 1998; Wenger et al., 2002). It consists of three aspects; domain, practice, and community. Each of these aspects is developed in relation to the other two. The Communities of Practice framework provides a fluid and dynamic research lens to study an environment that supports a knowledge base and fosters relationships with a group of people. Findings indicate that the graduate mathematics departments provide a variety of structures for supporting students and faculty, and that the departments foster relationships through many opportunities for social and academic interaction.

Examining the role of a STEM enrichment program in facilitating college readiness and retention among underserved students of color","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/1700836780?accountid=14692","Advancing the success of students of color in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is a pressing and complex issue. There are several trends (e.g., changing demographics, an aging workforce, and globally competitive market), which make improving retention and success among students of color in STEM fields important. STEM enrichment programs have shown promise in sustaining underrepresented students' science interests and strengthening their readiness for college level work. Thus, this study investigated how a STEM enrichment program facilitates college readiness and retention among students of color at a predominantly White, large, public, research university. In this study, I used an explanatory, holistic case study approach to examine the strategies and practices employed in the program to support student success (Yin, 2003). The study was conducted at Jefferson State University (pseudonym), a predominantly White, large, public research university in the Midwest. The Comprehensive STEM Program (CSP, pseudonym) at Jefferson State was established in 2007 with the National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NSF-LSAMP) grant. CSP contains eight program components: a six-week academic intensive residential summer bridge program, bi-weekly advising meetings, weekly recitation sessions, selected STEM sections of math and science courses, first-year seminar, residential assignment, peer mentoring, and undergraduate research opportunity. The program capacity is 50 students. The conceptual framework that guided this study integrated three theoretical constructs: (1) the Expertise Model of Students Success (EMSS), (2) sense of belonging, and (3) science identity. Drawing upon expert's systems theory, EMSS contends that identification of barriers, knowledge, and actions are central to understanding the student experience and student retention. The sense of belonging and science identity constructs provided additional lenses to explore how the program fostered community and academic and professional development opportunities for its participants. To explore my research questions, I interviewed 50 individuals: 42 current and former program participants, 2 administrators, 2 instructors, and 4 recent baccalaureate recipients and former program participants. I also conducted 24 hours of participant observations and analyzed over 200 pages of documents. A Model for Programmatic Influences on College Readiness and Retention among Underserved Students of color emerged from the findings. This model is comprised of four major themes: proactive caring, holistic support, community building, and STEM identity development catalyst. Proactive caring was found to be a philosophy and approach used for student retention. Holistic support attended to the myriad of needs of the program participants. Community building practices created a familial atmosphere and conditions to develop meaningful relationships. STEM identity development catalysts were the ways in which the program buttressed science identity development. This study concludes with recommendations for practice, policy, future research, and theory on students of color pursuing degrees in the STEM disciplines. The implications from this study support the need for continued federal and institutional support for STEM enrichment programs to address opportunity gaps, provide a supportive and caring environment for underrepresented groups, and bolster pathways for STEM identity development.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:37","2018-06-25 16:14:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intersectional, mixed-method data for this dissertation include in-depth interviews, focus groups, and student survey responses from various STEM contexts across multiple institutions in the Southwest. I discuss how traditional academic cultural environments are experienced differently than alternative cultural (program) environments and the implications for integrated identity development. I argue that sociological theories of education such as Tinto and Weidman’s of access and retention need to be revised to include the role of cultural context. Specifically, Multicontext theory, which encompasses the role of cultural context, pedagogy and student identity, elucidates the importance of providing Multicontextual environments for advancing inclusive excellence in higher education.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:37","2018-06-25 16:14:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social cognitive career theory and its critiques provided a theoretical foundation for relationships from past performance, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and college environment variables (compositional diversity, racial climate, gendered climate, academic peer support), to academic self-efficacy and achievement. Data were collected through an online survey. Instrumentation included the scales of Language, Identity, and Behavioral Acculturation; Gender Discrimination; Faculty and Classroom Behavior; Interactions with Peers; and Academic Milestones Self-efficacy. The participants were 228 Asian American undergraduate women in STEM at a large public, doctoral research extensive university on the east coast; the response rate was 51%. In three MANOVAs for nine social cognitive career variables, four ethnic groups (East, South, Southeast, and Multi-ethnic Asian American) significantly differed only on socioeconomic status. In path analysis, the initial model was not a good fit and was rejected. The model was respecified through statistical and theoretical evaluation, tested in exploratory analysis, and considered a good fit. The respecified model explained 36% of semester GPA (achievement) and 28% of academic self-efficacy. The academic achievement of Asian American women in STEM was related to past performance, background contextual factors, academic self-efficacy, academic peer support, and gendered climate. The strongest direct influence on achievement was academic self-efficacy followed by past performance. The total effect of Asian acculturation on achievement was negative and the total effect of American acculturation on achievement was not significant; academic self-efficacy mediated these complex relationships. The total effects of racial and gendered compositional diversity and racial climate on both academic self-efficacy and achievement were not significant. Students in majors with more female peers reported less academic peer support. In this study, when culturally specific variables embellished social cognitive career theory, the theory exhibited cultural validity for undergraduate Asian American women in STEM. The nature of the relationships among culturally specific variables and college environment variables, however, requires further study.","2005","2018-06-25 16:14:38","2018-06-25 16:14:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite efforts over the past 30 years, many obstacles remain to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in STEM fields. The present study utilized Lent, Brown, and Hackett's (1996) Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to help gain a better understanding of why female doctoral students in STEM fields choose not to pursue academic jobs by examining their conceptualization or mental model of academic work. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, male and female doctoral students in STEM who varied in their commitment to a career in academia were compared on the five SCCT factors of genetically-determined characteristics, overt career-related behaviors, self-efficacy, goals, and outcome expectations. Focus groups and a follow-up questionnaire were utilized. Results provided support for gender differences within those who intended to take academic jobs following completion of the doctorate as well as among those who intended to pursue jobs outside of academia. Key factors associated with interest in academia included a desire to teach in females and an optimistic perspective regarding many aspects of academic life in the males. Rejection of academic jobs by female participants was consistent with a lack of self-confidence for being effective in a faculty position. For males, disinterest in academia stemmed from poor male role models and a negative mental model of academic work.","2009","2018-06-25 16:14:38","2018-06-25 16:14:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, no analyses of educational sex segregation have comprehensively examined segregation within one discipline. To move beyond traditional methods of studying the long-standing stratification by field of study in higher education, I explore gender stratification within one field: engineering. This dissertation investigates why some engineering disciplines have a greater representation of women than other engineering disciplines. I assess the individual and institutional factors and conditions associated with women's representation in certain engineering departments and compare the mechanisms affecting women's and men's choice of majors. I use national data from the Engineering Workforce Commission, survey data from 21 schools in the Project to Assess Climate in Engineering study, and Carnegie Foundation classification information to study sex segregation in engineering majors from multiple perspectives: the individual, major, institution, and country. I utilize correlations, t-tests, cross-tabulations, log-linear modeling, multilevel logistic regression and weighted least squares regression to test the relative utility of alternative explanations for women's disproportionate representation across engineering majors. As a whole, the analyses illustrate the importance of context and environment for women's representation in engineering majors. Hypotheses regarding hostile climate and discrimination find wide support across different analyses, suggesting that women's under-representation in certain engineering majors is not a question of choice or ability. However, individual level factors such as having engineering coursework prior to college show an especially strong association with student choice of major. Overall, the analyses indicate that institutions matter, albeit less for women, and women's under-representation in engineering is not reducible to individual choice. This dissertation provides a broad, descriptive view of the state of sex segregation in engineering as well as a careful analysis of how individual and institutional factors inhibit or encourage sex segregation.

Research on this topic, as well as related self-esteem literature, suggest that women may be more likely than men to leave engineering if they have unmet grade expectations. Additionally, the presence of more women in engineering courses may positively influence women‘s persistence through peer reinforcement and the mitigation of possible social identity threat. This study explored differing degree outcomes for four cohorts of baccalaureate men and women (N=3,087) in a selective undergraduate engineering program by examining persistence at three levels: within the institution, within engineering, and within the originally intended engineering major, using three nested logistic regressions with increasingly restrictive criteria. The study hypothesized positive relationships between women and grades, between women and the proportion of other women in engineering-related courses (female density), and a conditional relationship among being female, grades, and female density. Women with high grades and a higher female density in courses should be more likely to persist in their originally chosen major or within engineering than men in the same situation. The findings did not support these hypotheses. Grades influenced men and women equally at the institution and major levels. At the engineering level, however, men were more grade sensitive than women when earning equal GPAs after the first year in college. In terms of female density, the study found negative main effects at all three levels. Moreover, the negative interaction between being female and female density approached significance at the engineering level. A different statistical method is needed, however, before any conclusions can be reached. The study also finds a flow of students between engineering fields as well as out of engineering, with aspiration to some majors facilitating the former or the latter. The significant majors change with the level of analysis. Finally, if historically underrepresented students graduate within six years, they are more likely than majority peers to graduate in their originally intended major.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:38","2018-06-25 16:14:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decrease in the proportion of women and underrepresented minorities in biomedical engineering from the bachelors to the masters to the doctoral levels is evidence of a still leaky pipeline in our discipline. In addition, the percentage of women faculty members at the assistant, associate and full professor levels remain disappointingly low even after years of improved recruitment of women into biomedical engineering at the undergraduate level. Worse, the percentage of women graduating with undergraduate degrees in biomedical engineering has been decreasing nationwide for the most recent three year span for which national data are available.

To understand why more graduate women do not pursue careers in academia, this mixed methods study focuses on the experiences of women currently in graduate engineering programs, and how the graduate culture shapes their development and decisions about future careers. The study includes data from 110 U.S. and international women enrolled in graduate engineering programs at research-intensive universities. As women experience graduate engineering programs, their views of themselves and their relationships with others develop. Graduate women who experience engineering cultures that encourage collaboration, confront sexism of any form, value diversity, recognize everyone's achievements, and assess on performance rather than gender tend to develop positively. Women who experience less supportive graduate cultures struggle to develop solid identities, comfort in partnerships, confidence needed to tackle challenges, and self-authoring capacity. Women enter graduate engineering programs from diverse cultural backgrounds, and their backgrounds shape their responses to the culture of their graduate program. International women face additional challenges in U.S. graduate engineering programs and struggle more in their development. Overall, women who experience unsupportive graduate cultures are less likely to form positive views of faculty careers, less likely to identify with engineering, and less likely to have the developmental attributes needed to succeed as a faculty member in engineering. Graduate engineering culture influences women's career decisions both indirectly, through development, and directly, by giving a picture of what an academic career may be like. The findings from the study suggest that practice and policy geared toward increasing the numbers of women among engineering faculty requires cultural transformation that considers the diversity of women who enter graduate engineering programs.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:38","2018-06-25 16:14:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study filled that gap by utilizing qualitative methods to investigate the life stories of tenured women faculty in engineering, including the challenges they faced and overcame and how they navigated their career. The participants in this study were female tenured associate and full professors at three doctoral research universities (Carnegie Classification: Research University/Very High Research Activity) in the United States. This study sought to understand the challenges that female engineering faculty faced in their careers, as well as the institutional policies and programs (i.e. family-friendly policies, diversity/equity programs, mentoring initiatives, etc.) that helped them to be successful in obtaining tenure. The stories of the twenty-one tenured female engineering professors in this study depicted the unique experiences that women faculty face as a gender minority in academic engineering programs. By situating this study within the context of three selective doctoral granting institutions, this study was unique in that it uncovered how institutional processes and programs directly influenced the success of women faculty in engineering. Although women at all three universities faced similar challenges including gender bias, work/family conflict, the “two-body problem,” among other barriers, interviewees’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the policies and programs differed significantly by site. This study provided insights into how women faculty perceive many of these programs as well as the factors that influence the decision to utilize the policies that were implemented to support women faculty in engineering.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:38","2018-06-25 16:14:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This phenomenon has been described as a ""leaky pipeline"" where fewer women advance to higher levels of the pipeline. A possible mechanism behind the leaky pipeline is stereotype threat, the fear of being negatively evaluated because of one's group membership. Stereotype threat can undermine the performance of the members of any disadvantaged group. For example, women may not perform well on science tasks because of the stereotype that ""women can't do science."" This project examined whether stereotype threat negatively influences performance on an Implicit Association Test (IAT), a test that measures unconscious attitudes. The sample included 311 male and female students and faculty. In order to activate stereotype threat, participants in the experimental condition were asked to indicate their gender and were given instructions that the test is intended to measure scientific thinking. A series of two-way ANOVAs included gender, discipline (science, social science, non-science), or student-faculty status (undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty) as the first independent variable; experimental condition was the second independent variable. Performance on the IAT was the dependent variable, where high scores represented greater implicit endorsement of traditional gender-science stereotypes. Results indicated no differences by gender. The discipline analyses revealed an interaction between discipline and experimental condition. Individuals in the no-stereotype-threat condition (control) from science disciplines showed greater endorsement of traditional gender stereotypes, followed by individuals in social science disciplines, and individuals in non-science disciplines. There were no differences in the stereotype-threat condition. The student-faculty analyses found that there were differences between undergraduate students and all other participants. Graduate students and faculty in the no-stereotype-threat condition showed greater endorsement of traditional gender stereotypes than undergraduate students in the no-stereotype-threat condition, while there were no differences in the stereotype-threat condition. A structural equation model found that, for men, a latent construct measuring General Academics was a predictor of a latent construct measuring Science Identification, which in turn was a predictor of the performance on the IAT. The structural equation model did not fit as well for women. Implications for women in science and the leaky pipeline are discussed.","2009","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has provided evidence that many factors contribute to this phenomenon, including negative stereotypes of women's abilities in STEM and women's lowered identification with STEM fields. This dissertation aimed to demonstrate how stereotyping and identity are part of a pattern of cognitive associations. In particular, the research considers the role of gendered traits (i.e., agentic and communal traits). The goal of Study 1 was to identify how gendered traits correspond to traits necessary in science fields. Results demonstrated that agentic traits are viewed as more necessary for success in science fields. Next, Study 2 aimed to demonstrate that the agency-science association is related to gender-science stereotyping and women's identification with science by experimentally manipulating the agency-science association. Results revealed that male and female students who are exposed to the agentic-science association have a stronger relationship between their gender-science stereotyping and science identity than those exposed to a communal-science association. Study 3 took an individual-differences perspective to test whether a meaningful pattern of associations involving the self, sex, traits (agentic & communal), and science emerges. This model is referred to as the pyramidal model of sex stereotyping, and it delineates a pattern of associations that may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in science. Results revealed that people do hold cognitively consistent patterns, particularly those who are in stereotypical fields for their gender (e.g., men in STEM and women in humanities), and that these patterns predict behavioral choices and career intentions. Finally, Study 4 tested an intervention based on the pyramidal model by experimentally manipulating the association between gendered traits and science fields, revealing that increasing communal-science associations increases the degree to which women in STEM form cognitively consistent patterns of associations. Together, these four studies provide evidence for the role of gendered traits in the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, while offering a theoretical contribution by emphasizing the importance of examining patterns of associations rather than isolated stereotypes. Future research should consider these patterns when designing interventions to increase women's participation in science fields.","2011","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite national efforts to enhance the quality of STEM education for students, progress remains elusive. Underperformance is evident in measures of outcomes, participation, and retention. In particular, inequity persists in the attraction and retention of women to STEM fields. Mentoring is heavily cited as a means to improve our national efforts to fortify STEM education. This research explores mentoring styles, gender preferences, and differential impact on outcomes. The results challenge conventional wisdom that women prefer and benefit from a style of mentoring that is different from the preferred style of men. This study found that male and female protégés do not desire different types of mentoring. In fact, male and female protégés desire task-oriented mentoring when compared to relationship-oriented mentoring styles. However, female protégés prefer to be mentored by female mentors and male protégés prefer to be mentored by male mentors. In addition, with respect to gender, mentors do not differ in the type of mentoring they employ. Additionally, results of the study indicate that task-oriented mentoring style may bring incremental explanatory power with regard to intention to pursue STEM careers. This research implicates STEM program design in university settings. Gender-focused STEM programs are advised to focus on preferences and mentoring type, but not in the conventional way. This research indicates that women in STEM disciplines are not expressing a preference for relationship-oriented mentoring type and do benefit from task-oriented mentoring styles.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Self-Prototype Matching Approach to Women's Underrepresentation in STEM Fields","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/1629063165?accountid=14692","Why are women approaching parity in some science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors but still lagging behind in others? I construct a multidimensional scaling map to understand which clusters of majors appear most unattractive to female students, and found that fields seen as scientific rather than cultural and as related to artificial kinds rather than nature were seen as least interesting by women. I then investigated the stereotypes which make those majors seem unappealing. I approach this from a self-prototype matching context, meaning that I predicted that participants would be most interested in majors whose stereotypes matched their self-image. A multi-level model was employed to examine the within-subjects patterns of response to various majors given stereotypes about those majors. Participants did in fact prefer majors whose stereotypes were similar to their self-stereotypes, and this tendency mediated gender differences in interest. In particular, stereotypes about agency, communion, and technological or ""geeky"" recreational interests were strong mediators. I also examined the consistency across subjects of these effects. Some stereotypes (such as agency) were high-consensus, meaning that subjects consistently took them into account, expressing more interest in majors that were similar to them in those stereotypes and less in majors which were not. Others (such as sociability) were low-consensus, meaning that some subjects took them into account very strongly and others very weakly. Taken together, these results suggest that researchers studying stereotypes should expect the effects of those stereotypes to vary between subjects, and to depend particularly on those subjects' self-perception. Researchers studying the low-consensus stereotypes here should be particularly aware of this possibility, but all should take into account that the same intervention may have opposite effects for participants with opposite self-ratings. This dissertation advocates for interventions which emphasize the diversity of STEM fields and suggest that more than one prototypical class of student can succeed in them.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this progress, women are still underrepresented in many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and the model of Achievement Related Choices are two widely accepted career development theories. Both theories highlight the importance of self-efficacy and personal factors in career development; yet, neither of them has considered the predictive power of a specific outcome expectation, anticipated work family conflict (AWFC), in relation to the career development of men and women in STEM undergraduate programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the incremental validity of AWFC over and above that of self-efficacy and role salience, in predicting educational and occupational aspirations of undergraduate students in STEM programs at a large southwestern university. The study provides evidence that the factor structure of the AWFC scale does not hold up with the undergraduate population, and this finding was seen as reason to combine the AWFC subscales into one composite score. In a hierarchical multiple regression higher levels of STEM self-efficacy predicted higher intentions to persist in STEM. Role salience, AWFC, and the gender-AWFC interaction were not significantly related to intentions to persist. Although the study does not provide evidence for the incremental validity of AWFC, it does suggest that work-family balance considerations that have been observed in mature STEM populations may not yet be salient for students at the undergraduate level.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A quantitative research design with a qualitative component was employed. Ex post facto survey research was conducted utilizing an online questionnaire to collect data from participants. African American undergraduate females that had declared a major in STEM comprised the target population for the study. As a basis for comparison, a second data collection ensued. All non-African American undergraduate females majoring in STEM also received the survey instrument to determine if there was a significant difference between factors that influence STEM major selection between the two groups. The Social Cognitive Career Choice Model comprised the conceptual framework for this study. Frequencies and percentages illustrated the demographic characteristics of the sample, as well as the average influence levels of each of the items without regard for level of significance. The researcher conducted an independent samples t-test to compare the mean scores for undergraduate African American females majoring in STEM and non-African American females majoring in STEM on each influential factor on the survey instrument. The researcher coded responses to open-ended questions to generate themes and descriptions. The data showed that African American female respondents were very influenced by the following items: specific interest in the subject, type of work, availability of career opportunities after graduation, parent/guardian, precollege coursework in science, and introductory college courses. In addition, the majority of respondents were very influenced by each of the confidence factors. African American females were overwhelmingly not influenced by aptitude tests. African American females were more influenced than their non-African American female counterparts for the following factors: reputation of the university, college or department, high level of compensation in fields, religious leaders, precollege coursework in mathematics, confidence in mathematics ability, confidence in ability to be successful in mathematics in college, confidence in science ability, and confidence in ability to be successful in science in college. Non-African American females were more influenced than African American females by the precollege coursework in technology and the precollege STEM experience factors. Four themes emerged regarding the items that most influenced success in STEM for African American females: high level of compensation in the field, parents/legal guardians and family members, specific interest in the subject, and confidence in science and math ability.

While the socialization process is fundamental to doctoral success and consequently deserves attention, it is critical to inquire into how the widespread and lasting perception of people of color as socioculturally deficient shapes underrepresented students` socialization into science doctoral programs. Further, the existing research literature and educational policies addressing the persistent underrepresentation of students of color in science doctorates remain fixated on increasing racial diversity for U.S. economic security rather than racial equity. In view of the limitation of existing research literature, in this study, drawing from critical race theories, fictive-kinship, and forms of capital, I use counterstorytelling to recast racial inequities in the education of science doctorates as a problem of social justice, not as an issue of the students' sociocultural deficits or as a matter of economic security. Through interviews I examined the experiences, from elementary school to current careers, of three women of color who were science doctoral students. Participants' counterstories revealed institutionalized racism embedded in doctoral programs exploited their identities and dismissed their lived experiences, thereby, relegating them to outsiders-within academe. This marginalization precluded the inclusive socialization of participants into their doctoral programs and ultimately set up barriers to their pursuit of scientific careers. This study divulges the academic and career consequences of the sustained privilege disparities between underrepresented students of color's experience and the experiences of their white and Asian counterparts. In light of the participants' experiences, I recommend that, in order to change the existing policy of socially integrating students into oppressive cultures, researchers and policymakers must forefront the humanity of underrepresented students of color when forming research questions, determining data collection instruments, and selecting analytical tools, thus changing the sociocultural structure of the science doctoral process.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:39","2018-06-25 16:14:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data about the decision to major in an engineering field were collected from interviews with first and second year female college students and analyzed with qualitative methods. Student interest in fields related to engineering such as math and science was the main influence to select an engineering major for study participants. Participants showed a strong preference for math and science in high school, and were often influenced by family or school personnel to select an engineering major. Participants considered potential future job opportunities when selecting to major in engineering, and to a lesser extent, earnings potential.

This study contributes to understanding how African American women are successful in obtaining baccalaureate degrees in the sciences. Specifically, through surveying students from multiple institutions of higher education, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominately White Institutions (PWIs), the study examined how African American undergraduate women’s self-efficacy, gender, race/ethnicity, department climate, and campus climate interact to promote career commitment. This project focused on a population at the crossroads of race and gender in STEM: African American women obtaining undergraduate degrees. Participants (N = 670) were African American (N = 375) and European American (N = 295) women and men enrolled in four universities in North Carolina (two PWIs, two HBCUs). Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the data. Results demonstrated that being a STEM major was the biggest predictor of career commitment across race and gender. For women with STEM majors, science/math self-efficacy emerged as the primary predictor of career commitment and perceptions of gender equality in one’s major department were especially important for African American women. These results can be used to inform educational policy about training faculty members in classroom and campus climate issues. The results may also be useful to those designing interventions, to address issues of science/math self-efficacy of students who plan to pursue STEM careers after graduation.","2012","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent STEM graduates (N= 235) were recruited via university alumni associations to complete measures of workplace experiences. Although men and women did not differ in perceptions of their organizational socialization experiences, some evidence indicated that women were less likely to persist. Fit-based socialization, that is, knowledge of the organization’s values and integration with the work team, predicted greater persistence, whereas task-based socialization (e.g., performance proficiency, history) was unrelated. Further, the relationship between fit-based socialization effectiveness and persistence was stronger for women, suggesting that interventions to bolster newcomers’ perceptions of fit during the socialization process may help to reduce attrition of recent STEM graduates and of women in particular. These results underscore the importance of environmental (vs. individual difference) factors that may affect persistence in STEM careers.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research examining women's experiences in STEM has highlighted several factors, both at the student- and institutional-level, that contribute to women's continued underrepresentation in STEM, especially in fields such as engineering and computer science (NSF, 2009). However, few of these studies take into account the effect of peer relationships on students' experiences in STEM. As friendships have been shown to have particular significance in the lives of women, it seems clear that research on women's underrepresentation in STEM would benefit from an examination of the relationships between friendships and academic and social outcomes. Data for this study are drawn from UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program's 1996 Freshman Survey and the 2000 College Student Survey (CSS). The 2000 CSS includes a key variable which asks students about the proportion of close friends they have of a particular social or demographic group, including one's major. The study sample includes data for 1,478 women and 1,406 men, all of whom completed both surveys and indicated on the 2000 CSS that they will graduate with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. Findings from this investigation confirm that same-major friends can positively impact STEM students' academic and social outcomes. Regression results indicate that, for men, having higher proportions of same-major friends corresponds to an increased likelihood of aspiring to have a STEM career and higher levels of science identity goals and scientific orientation. However for women, having more same-major friends was significantly related only to an increase in scientific orientation. While it was unexpected that same-major friendships would have a significant relationship with more outcomes for men than women, this work does indicate a small but positive impact of same-major friends for STEM students. However, same-major friends did not impact academic self-confidence and psychological well-being for this study sample. Based on these findings, recommendations for faculty, student affairs practitioners and administrators on encouraging friendship formation among STEM students are posed, as well as suggestions for future research to expand on our knowledge of peel relationships and STEM student experiences in college.","2011","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers term this phenomenon “the leaky pipeline.” While the issue is well-documented in the literature, little is known about its antecedents. The current study offers insight into factors that relate to career choice and contribute to the lack of diversity in STEM fields by investigating how sense of belonging and psychological capital (PsyCap) influence important psychological and academic and career outcomes for women in these fields. Female undergraduate STEM majors were recruited for participation at two times during the fall academic semester (N=182 at time one, N=86 at time two) and data were analyzed using correlation and regression. Results provide support for the influence of both sense of belonging and PsyCap as important correlates of an individual's academic and career making decisions. Specifically, PsyCap mediated the relationship between belonging and well-being and belonging and career outcomes of engagement and participants' intentions to apply to graduate programs in an unrelated major. In addition, PsyCap moderated the relationship between sense of belonging and participants' intentions to switch majors and intentions to apply to graduate programs in a field unrelated to their current major. An increased understanding of the factors that contribute to the leaky pipeline in STEM will serve as a basis for developing further research questions and targeting interventions.","2011","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate the barriers of women doctoral students in STEM fields which identified supporting factors for them as well. This study also tried to determine if there was any difference in perceiving barriers among three disciplines—engineering, life sciences and natural sciences. An online questionnaire (19 Likert-type questions and one open-ended question) was sent to women STEM doctoral students studying at the Arizona State University (ASU). Questions were based on some factors which might act as obstacles or supports during their doctoral studies. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Factors such as work-life balance, time-management, low self-confidence, lack of female role model, fewer numbers of women in science and engineering classes, and male dominated environment revealed as significant barriers according to both the analyses but factors such as difficulty with the curriculum, gender discrimination, and two-career problem were chosen as barriers only in the free response question. Positive treatment from advisor, family support, availability of funding, and absence of sexual harassment assisted these women continuing their PhD programs at ASU. However, no significant difference was observed with respect to perceiving barriers among the three groups mentioned above. Recommendations for change in science and engineering curricula and active recruitment of female faculty are discussed to reduce or at best to remove the barriers and how to facilitate participation and retention of more women in STEM fields especially at the doctoral level.","2011","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This quantitative study uses a multinomial regression approach, with the predictor variables entering the model in three groups to focus on relevant inputs and experiences. The outcome variable is level of math in the major at the end of the third year, and the predictor variables include ethnicity, gender, SAT math score, MSA score, family income, high school GPA, type of financial aid received, campus residency, first-year college GPA, whether remedial math was taken in college, level of math in the intended major during the first year, and RAC use for math tutoring during the first year. Multiple runs were performed, examining the female students only as well as the entire cohort. The findings for RAC use in almost every run were positive and statistically significant, suggesting that regular use of math tutoring during the first year helps students, especially women, achieve an outcome of a mid-level or high-level math-oriented major.","2007","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study combined (1) quantitative comparisons of biology persisters and switchers via a questionnaire developed for the study and survival analysis of a larger population of biology freshmen with (2) qualitative comparison of biology switchers and persisters via semi-structured life story interviews and homogenous focus groups. 319 students (207 persisters and 112 switchers) participated in the questionnaire and 36 students (20 persisters and 16 switchers) participated in life story and focus group interviews. All participants were undergraduates who entered The University of Texas at Austin as biology freshmen in the fall semesters of 2000 through 2004. Findings of this study suggest: (1) Regardless of eventual major, biology students enter college with generally the same suite of experiences, sources of personal encouragement, and reasons for choosing the biology major; (2) Despite the fact that they have also had poor experiences in the major, biology persisters do not actively decide to stay in the biology major; they simply do not leave; (3) Based upon survival analysis, biology students are most at-risk of leaving the biology major during the first two years of college and if they are African-American or Latino, women, or seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree (rather than a Bachelor of Science); (4) Biology switchers do not leave biology due to preference for other disciplines; they leave due to difficulties or dissatisfaction with aspects of the biology major, including their courses, faculty, and peers; (5) Biology performance has a differential effect on persistence in the biology major, depending on how well students perform in comparison to other courses or other students.","2008","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a social identity framework, this study addresses how gender influences undergraduate women’s perception of themselves, their role in the engineering community and their decision to persist. By capturing the experiences of 16 undergraduate women who are enrolled at two elite technical universities in Southern California, this qualitative study utilizes focus groups and individual interviews to provide key insight and perspective on the role of gender in their experience. Through the data, we learn perception has a significant impact on women, that women are willing to acclimate to a masculine culture as a means to both prove legitimacy and feel a sense of belonging and lastly, women manage their gender in two primary ways, one by integrating within the culture through adopting more masculine tendencies and second, by adapting to the environment as needed and persevering in spite of the masculine undercurrent. The implications at the conclusion of this study are two-fold. One focus is helping undergraduate women understand gendered experiences and bringing gender to the forefront of their experience and the second is studying the overall structure of this culture in an effort to move from a masculine, gender-neutral philosophy to one that is gender-sensitive and gender-inclusive.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A survey was used to collect data concerning the background characteristics as well as the community college and university experiences of transfer students. A purposive sample of female community college transfer students were interviewed to gather information about their overall socialization experiences. The researcher employed a hypothetical conceptual framework of undergraduate socialization for community college transfer students based on Weidman’s (1987) conceptual framework of undergraduate socialization. The hypothesized model was used to examine how selected variables—background characteristics, community college experiences, and university experiences—impacted the academic and social adjustment among community college transfer students. Quantitative analysis, including descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, and hierarchical multiple regression, as well as qualitative analysis, including narrative inquiry, were used to analyze the data. Two hierarchical multiple regression models were used to examine the background characteristics and the community college and university variables that predict academic and social adjustment. The results of this study suggest that the background characteristics, including gender; community college experiences, including transfer semester hours, experience with faculty and transfer process; as well as university experiences that include negative general perception of transfer students, impacted the academic adjustment of community college transfer students. Similarly, a second hierarchical multiple regression model was used to examine the background characteristics and community and university variables that predict social adjustment. The results of this study suggest that the background characteristics parental household income level; community college experiences: academic advising, course learning; and university experiences: financial influential reasons for attending ISU and negative general perception of transfer students impacted the social adjustment of community college transfer students in STEM. Additionally, qualitative data, which focused on five female community college transfer students, highlight the role of parents, faculty, community colleges, and universities in the academic and social adjustment of community college transfer students in STEM majors. The study should be replicated in other research universities with a large transfer student population. In addition, it is imperative that policymakers and community college and university faculty and staff understand the socialization of transfer students to ensure the institutional environments are conducive to successful transfer and adjustment.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:40","2018-06-25 16:14:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the number of females who take physics in college has declined. While female students make up 61% of graduates in biological sciences and 50% in chemistry, the proportion of women completing physics degrees is only 21% (Sawtelle, 2011). In order to improve women’s access to science and engineering education, research must focus on personal and environmental factors that motivate them to select these fields (AAUW, 2010). The purpose of this study was to explore how the educational experiences of three female undergraduate physics majors contribute to their current dispositions toward, interest in, and pursuit of physics as a major at a large southern research university. This qualitative study employs symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969) as its methodological framework and social cognitive career theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 2002) as its theoretical framework. Case study methods (Yin, 2006) were implemented to investigate the experiences of three participants. The primary sources of data included critical incident interviews (Flanagan, 1954), photographs, documents, object elicitations, and the researcher’s reflections. Narrative and arts-based techniques were employed to analyze and represent data. Findings are presented as co-constructed narratives of the participants’ journeys to becoming undergraduate physics majors. Three major themes emerged from the cross case analysis: carving new spaces, authoring an empowered self, and show me you care and so will I. The direct experiences of engaging with science at a young age and social persuasions of family members, teachers, and peers strongly influenced the participants’ interest in and pursuit of physics. Their current dispositions to physics result from vicarious experiences with professors and peers in combination with the social persuasions of the latter. This study informs science educators in general, and physics educators in particular, about how to motivate and enable female students to engage with physics and possibly pursue it as a career choice. Three major implications for practice were suggested: teach science as a vibrant field, enable students to understand failure as an opportunity to succeed, and shift the focus from competition to collaboration.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:41","2018-06-25 16:14:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has shown that students who identify as engineers during their college years are more likely to persist in engineering (Beam, Pierrakos, Constantz, Johri, & Anderson, 2009; Pierrakos, Beam, Constantz, Johri, & Anderson, 2009). One way to study identification with engineering is through a study of engineering identity development. The current literature on engineering identity has primarily focused on an aggregated population of engineering students, leaving the experiences of students of color unexplored (Matusovich, Barry, Meyers, Louis, 2011; Meyers, Ohland, Pawley, Silliman, & Smith, 2012; Tonso, 2006). This study aims to address this literature gap and the underrepresentation of Latina/o students by investigating their development of engineering identity. In this study, I answered the following research question: In what ways and to what extent does membership in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) influence the engineering identity development of Latina/o students? The goal of this study was to produce a culturally situated understanding of the ways Latina/o students develop their engineering identities. To achieve this goal, I used a two-phase mixed methods design with a developmental purpose. Through this design, I conducted interviews and observations with Latina/o undergraduates using an asset-based and culturally situated approach guided by Yosso’s (2005) Community Cultural Wealth Framework. Using results from the interviews and observations, I created and piloted a culturally situated survey of engineering identity development for Latina/o student members of SHPE. This two-phase design revealed important and new dimensions of engineering identity development for Latina/o students. These new dimensions of engineering identity development were commitment to community, engineering role modeling, and nurturing an engineering familia. These dimensions build on and broaden current conceptualizations of engineering identity.

A methodology combining qualitative and quantitative analysis approaches was used to examine different aspects of the overarching research question, ""Why do undergraduate students leave college STEM fields of study?"" A quantitative review of institutional data was used to identify four particular gaps in student persistence and success in STEM fields of study at Texas State University.

A review of retention theories was undertaken to better inform the process of generating remedies to the STEM persistence issue. Data were collected and analyzed separately for each component to produce two sets of findings. Findings indicated that there were retention issues in regard to STEM majors in general and underrepresented student groups in particular. Underrepresented students do not pursue STEM degrees percentage wise in comparison to other degrees. The self-study and retention theories suggest the following remedial measures: supporting faculty to transform their teaching, providing supplemental instruction in math and science and including discipline specific introductory courses and early internship experiences.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:41","2018-06-25 16:14:41","","43-60","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study focuses on the perspectives of Black women and how they perceive the strategies and practices utilized at a single-sex HBCU that aid in fostering the successful development of Black women in STEM fields. Although limited to one institution, the findings shed light on the ways in which African American women experience the single-sex HBCU, and how the institution aids in their persistence in STEM majors. This study also discusses how such strategies and practices at a single-sex HBCU aid in mitigating the challenges and barriers that limit the attainment of African American women in STEM fields, and provides an opportunity for them to develop strong identities in STEM. Drawing on the findings, the paper concludes with recommendations for improving implementation of strategies revealed in historically Black colleges/universities and predominantly White colleges/ universities (PWIs). Recommendations for future research suggest that the experiences of African American women in single-sex and co-educational historically Black and predominantly White institutions could be further explored.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:41","2018-06-25 16:14:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the use of narratives, the research attempts to shed additional light on the informal and formal science learning experiences that motivates young females to major in STEM in order to help increase the number of women entering STEM careers and retaining women in STEM majors. In the addition to the narratives, surveys were performed to encompass a larger audience while looking for themes and phenomena which explore what captivates and motivates young females’ interests in science and continues to nurture and facilitate their growth throughout high school and college, and propel them into a major in STEM in college. The purpose of this study was to uncover the lived experiences of junior and senior undergraduate female science majors during their formal and informal education, their science motivation to learn science, their science identities, and any experiences in gender inequity they may have encountered. The findings have implications for young women deciding on future careers and majors through early exposure and guidance, understanding and recognizing what gender discrimination, and the positive effects of mentorships.","2017","2018-06-25 16:14:41","2018-06-25 16:14:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, much research efforts have been directed towards identifying factors causing the leaks in the STEM pipeline and finding effectively antidotes to patch the leakage points along the pipe. In the past, most studies in the STEM disciplines have focused on individual cognitive capacities (or academic predictors) such as precollege performance indicators (e.g., high school GPA) and standardized achievement test scores (e.g., SAT and ACT) to explain the leading factors contributing to the high attrition rate among STEM college students. Yet these studies just address mainly one aspect of the key reasons why students failed to persist. We still lack evidence, both empirically and theoretically, on how “ non-cognitive skills”—which are essential individual characteristics vital for success in any schooling, work, and other life-time outcomes—may influence STEM major persistence. Absent from most of the scholarly discussions are the many ways in which psychosocial factors (such as grit, tenacity, optimism, self-efficacy, perseverance, motivation, self-discipline, teamwork, reliability) influence the decision-making processes of students’ persistence. Rather than focusing on the traditional cognitive ability and academic achievement measures of academic preparation this study focused on psychosocial factors that influence the decision-making processes of students’ persistence and degree completion. The purpose of the study is to examine the extent to which non-cognitive factors (i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and interest) contribute to undergraduate students’ persistence and college degree completion in STEM with particular attention to students enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. The analytical sample for this study was drawn from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS:2002-2012) dataset with the final sample used for analysis representing the 2002 cohort of 10th graders who declared STEM major in college by 2006 and participated in the final wave of ELS in 2012. As such, the result was reflective of this group of students, and not all STEM students in college in general. Result of the study revealed three general findings about the three noncognitive factors. First, students with strong interest in pursuing a STEM major, a high sense of self-efficacy, and a mid to high level of outcome expectations are more likely to persist and complete their college degree in their declared major in STEM field. Students who reported that they had no interest in pursuing a STEM major yet declared a STEM major in their postsecondary education, and who have moderate to high self-efficacy and high outcome expectations are more likely to switch to a non-STEM major and persist to complete a degree in a non-STEM field. Thirdly, irrespective of whether the student was interested in pursuing STEM, a student with low self-efficacy and low outcome expectations was more likely to not attain any degree or credential.","2017","2018-06-25 16:14:41","2018-06-25 16:14:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research shows that females may be leaking from the STEM pipeline because they are not choosing to attend institutions that fulfill their interdisciplinary and non-academic interests or have learning environments that are supportive of their needs. The purpose of this quantitative, cross-sectional survey study, conducted at one non-research intensive university, was to identify institutional factors most pertinent to the decision to attend a non-research intensive university by a ""STEM qualified"" female undergraduate student. 23 of 45 factors were reported as positively influencing their decision regardless of major. The top six factors for both groups were: average class size, campus environment, a visit to campus, university population size, and major/department offered. The seven factors ranked statistically significantly different between STEM and non-STEM majors were undergraduate research opportunities, faculty reputation, graduate/professional school admission, academic support/tutoring, graduate program available, intramural sports, and off-campus housing. Only two of 17 factors negatively influenced STEM majors who were accepted to a research intensive university: the research intensive university's size and average class sizes were undesirable compared to their current institution. STEM qualified females weighed the importance of non-academic factors as high, or higher, than critical academic factors. STEM qualified females are also choosing to attend the non-research intensive university for a variety of reasons and not simply because another institution did not offer certain academic factors. Future studies should expanded to include other non-research intensive universities, research intensive universities, and high schools in order to further understand the impact that certain factors have on female choice of institution. The authors strongly feel that if institutions which provide a more supportive environment for female undergraduates create successful recruitment initiatives, their female students may be more likely to persist as STEM majors. This could potentially patch one of the substantial leaks in the STEM pipeline for women.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2019-10-23 13:48:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychological predictors were gender, the need to belong, self-esteem, perceived personal discrimination, and perceived group discrimination. We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk to recruit participants and Survey Monkey to conduct an online survey. Participants were 174 men and women who worked or studied in STEM fields. Two-step hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the data. As a result, we found that all predictors mentioned above accounted for the variance in the intention to leave a job. Self-esteem and perceived personal discrimination were critical predictors for men in STEM fields; self-esteem and perceived group discrimination were critical predictors for women in STEM fields. For women, interestingly, the interaction effect of the need to belong and self-esteem added an additional variance in predicting the intention to leave a job. The need to belong buffered the effect of self-esteem on the intention of STEM women to leave a job. Thus, it might be that STEM women with low self-esteem are more likely to change a job if their need to belong is not fulfilled.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2018-06-25 16:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is set within the framework of Bandura’s social cognitive theory which holds that an individual can consciously learn and choose behaviors that will influence outcomes within their environments. Two aspects of social cognitive theory, self-regulation and self-efficacy, are central to the study. This study showed that strategies and behaviors exist that women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics can utilize to overcome the pervasive gender-based barriers to leadership frequently encountered in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Foundational to one’s ability to apply these mitigating mechanisms known as buffering behaviors is a strong sense of self-efficacy, which developed for the women in this study early in life.

As a result, undergraduate women majoring in STEM fields face a uniquely difficult path; yet, for the most part, recommendations made and supported in the literature have focused on recruitment of women to STEM fields or on ways to make women more successful and comfortable in their STEM major. These recommendations have so far proved to be insufficient to remedy a gender gap and serve to replicate the existing male hierarchy. In order to truly make the STEM classroom one in which women are welcome and comfortable and to challenge the existing social and scientific systems, it is necessary to explore and understand the social and political implications embedded within teaching and learning choices. This institutional ethnography addresses that gap. The purpose of this study was to uncover and describe the institutional practices of STEM education at a Midwest research university (MRU) from the standpoint of female undergraduate students. Using the framework of feminist standpoint theory, this study explored the everyday “work” of female undergraduate STEM students to provide a unique perspective on the STEM education teaching and learning environment. Data collection began with in-depth interviews with female undergraduate math and physics students. As the institutional processes shaping undergraduate participant experiences were identified, subsequent data collection included classroom observations, additional interviews with students and faculty, and analysis of the texts that mediate these processes (e.g., syllabi and student handbooks). Data analysis followed Carspecken’s process of ethnographic data analysis that began with low-level coding, followed by high-level coding, and concluded by pulling codes together through the creation of themes. Analysis of data led to three key findings. First, undergraduate participants reported being challenged by difficult and intimidating aspects of the teaching and learning environment. Second, undergraduate participants reported challenges meeting some of the characteristics of successful math and physics students (e.g., taking risks, asking questions, putting school first) and preferred a collectivistic environment. Third, participants described challenges from conflicting STEM academic expectations and institutional policies, which made it harder for them to meet STEM expectations. Findings indicate that efforts to reduce the “chilly” climate have been unsuccessful, largely because discourses that motivate the chilly climate have not changed. Those discourses are evidence of a masculine STEM institution, which also creates a male ideal that female students are expected to meet, further exacerbating their discomfort in the STEM environment. The masculinized nature of a STEM institution is reinforced by neoliberal policies that emphasize the importance of meeting gendered ideal STEM student characteristics. The result is that while women persist, they face stress, anxiety, and discomfort. Recommendations to improve the chilly climate include: revising the STEM institution from one that is masculine to one that is inclusive of women; and, to create a STEM educational environment that supports, validates, and gives women an equal voice.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2018-06-25 16:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positive marginality describes the perception that belonging to a non-dominant cultural or demographic group can be advantageous rather than oppressing. To date, research on positive marginality has explored the construct in a qualitative manner across a number of demographic groups (e.g., Jewish women in social sciences, African American women in predominantly Caucasian workplaces). Because women are largely underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, the current research examined positive marginality in a STEM context. This research advances the existing understanding of positive marginality through two studies. Study 1 tested the psychometric properties of a new measure of positive marginality. A qualitative pilot study informed the generation of a measure of positive marginality which was administered to a sample of 105 sophomore and junior STEM majors (Study 1A) and a sample of 433 women working in STEM occupations (Study 1B). Exploratory factor analyses were conducted in Study 1A and 1B as well as a confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1B to test a hypothesized 3-factor structure of positive marginality. Results of Study 1 supported a single-factor structure of positive marginality. Study 2 identified and assessed a partial nomological network of the unidimensional construct among women working in STEM occupations. Specifically, a sample of 313 women working in STEM occupations were surveyed at two time points on hypothesized antecedents and outcomes of positive marginality. Structural equation modeling suggested support for core self-evaluations, need for achievement, and domain identification as antecedents of positive marginality; career satisfaction and persistence intentions were supported as outcomes of positive marginality for women in STEM. Together, these studies provide support for the relevance of positive marginality to women pursuing STEM careers and demonstrate the relationship between positive marginality and individual differences and career outcomes. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2018-06-25 16:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined an out-of-school science education program which combined traditional Native American cultural and ecological knowledge with Western science in conducting authentic field studies. A qualitative, embedded case study approach was used to explore how young Native American women were influenced by an out-of-school program integrating a culturally responsive approach and experiential research projects. Within this context of combined cultures, three significant domains emerged: field study in science, sense of place, and networks of supportive relationships. These domains interacted with the aspirations of the eight Native women in the study. Using interview transcripts, reflective writings, and participant data, the study explored the blending of Indigenous and Western science in “communities of practice” (e.g., fisheries biology, restoration ecology, and forestry). The eight Native women in this study participated as young adolescents and later returned as counselors. Interviews focused on their postsecondary aspirations and choices. Findings validated previous research on the value of infusing Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western science for Native students. The study found the combination of culturally responsive pedagogy and authentic experiences in “communities-of-practice” held a beneficial influence on postsecondary pathways. The importance of respect and friendships fostered through the program was associated with resilience and perseverance in educational aspirations. Immersion in field study with Native peers as well as Native and non-Native researchers was a catalyst for all the women, in a number of different ways, such as: deeper involvement with the Native community, strengthening cultural and academic identity, inspiration to learn more about their cultural heritage, and interest in pursuing science or science-related careers. Commitments to “giving back” to the community, stewardship, and activism emerged as significant outcomes. The experience created a safe, empowering place to be Native, “crazy, a scientist, and a fish geek”—all at once.","2008","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2018-06-25 16:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the increase of women in the STEM workforce, women remain underrepresented among engineering majors (Beasley & Fischer, 2012; Heilbronner, 2012; Neihart & Teo, 2013). Few studies exist that utilize a retrospective approach to understand how the culmination of young women’s K-14 experiences have influenced their formation of individually held perceptions that lead to engineering persistence. It is this study’s aim to utilize a mixed-methods approach to answer the following research question: How do young women’s perceptions of their K-14 STEM experiences influence their decision to enroll and persist in an engineering major? These perceptions are explored through an ethnographic approach focusing on young women enrolled in engineering programs during their junior and senior years of study at a small private liberal arts university with eight engineering majors. The mixed-methods approach follows a sequential design method (Creswell, 2013) and utilizes questions in a quantitative Likert-type survey from the Academic Pathways for People Learning Engineering (APPLES) survey (Eris, Chachra, Chen, Sheppard, & Ludlow, 2010) and the Motivated Strategy Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1991).

In addition, of those that seek to pursue STEM fields in the United States, only 26% are female. In order to increase the number of women seeking STEM based bachelor's degrees, K-12 education must provide a foundation that prepares students for entry into these fields. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to determine the perceived K-12 experiences that influenced females to pursue a STEM field. Twelve college juniors or seniors seeking a degree in Biology, Mathematics, or Physics were interviewed concerning their K-12 experiences. These interviews were analyzed and six themes emerged. Teacher passion and classroom characteristics such as incorporating challenging activities played a significant role in the females' decisions to enter STEM fields. Extra-curricular activities such as volunteer and mentor opportunities and the females' need to benefit others also influenced females in their career choice. Both the formal (within the school) and informal (outside of the traditional classroom) pipeline opportunities that these students encountered helped develop a sense of self-efficacy in science and mathematics; this self-efficacy enabled them to persist in pursuing these career fields. Several participants cited barriers that they encountered in K-12 education, but these barriers were primarily internal as they struggled with overcoming self-imposed obstacles in learning and being competitive in the mathematics and science classrooms. The experiences from these female students can be used by K-12 educators to prepare and encourage current female students to enter STEM occupations.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:42","2018-06-25 16:14:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering revealed that the number of minorities pursuing STEM degrees and careers has declined over the past few years. The specific origins of this trend are not quite evident; one variable to consider is that undergraduate minority students are failing in STEM disciplines at various levels of education from elementary to postsecondary. The failure of female and minority students to enter STEM disciplines in higher education have led various initiatives to establish programs to promote STEM disciplines among these groups. Additional funding for minority STEM programs have led to a increase in undergraduate minority students entering STEM disciplines, but the minority students’ graduation rate in STEM disciplines is approximately 7% lower than the graduation of nonminority students in STEM disciplines. This phenomenological qualitative research study explores the lived experiences of underrepresented minority undergraduate college students participating in an undergraduate minority-mentoring program.

Many studies on barriers for female students in STEM attribute having a mentor as a positive influence in breaking these barriers down. Beneficial outcomes have been shown to cover diverse areas. What is not as commonly studied is the value of having a peer mentor in the success of these students. Even more atypical, is to study impact on the peer serving in the mentoring role, especially female peer mentors in the STEM disciplines (Lockie & Van Lanen, 2008). My research examined the experiences of women in STEM majors taking on high levels of leadership in mentoring and teaching, who I referred to as peer instructors. The focus was on the social-cognitive psychological paradigm, seeking to gain information on influences of peers, models, and culture within majors on the four sources of the construct of academic self-efficacy: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and physiological and emotional responses. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 12 participants representing multiple academic peer support programs at one urban research institution. Merriam’s (2009) basic qualitative study design was employed to examine “1) how people interpret their experiences, 2) how they construct their worlds, and 3) what meaning they attribute to their experiences” (p. 23). Participants provided many examples of how their self-efficacy toward their STEM domain, and in turn, their persistence and success in the disciplinary program, was positively influenced by their peer instructor experience. Time spent in the position resulted in mastery of the role in multiple areas; models were highly influential in the faculty, staff, and peers they interacted with because of their role; positive messaging from external sources changed negative self-perceptions of abilities and gave them drive to persist and achieve even more success in their domain; and physiological and emotional states regarding how they judged their own skills and abilities were positively influenced by each source.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2018-06-25 16:14:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prevalence of anxiety among females is considerably higher than male students, which could affect retention of women in STEM fields. One factor that could explain this phenomenon is stereotype threat. A review of the literature provides support that females experience higher levels of anxiety and that using relaxation techniques is an effective modality in a group setting. The 8-week group is designed to support female STEM majors and to teach this population how to recognize and manage their anxiety so it does not interfere with their studies. The goal of the group is to reduce anxiety by utilizing relaxation techniques (RT); a byproduct of the group is that it could help maintain and increase retention of female students in STEM majors.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2018-06-25 16:14:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conceptual framework combined two college impact models, Weidman's (1989) model of undergraduate socialization and Astin's (1991) input-environment-outcome model, with a transformative perspective (Mertens, 2005) to examine sense of belonging among women of color in STEM majors. Data came from the 2004 National Study of Living-Learning Programs, and included 1,722 women in undergraduate STEM majors from 29 institutions in the U.S. identifying as Black/African American, Asian Pacific American, Latina, American Indian, Multiracial/Multiethnic, and White/Caucasian. Results from two-way ANOVAs revealed that women of color reported a less strong sense of belonging than White/Caucasian women and had more interactions with diverse peers than White/Caucasian women. In addition, Black/African American women perceived a less positive campus racial climate than women from other racial/ethnic groups. Significant predictors in a hierarchical multiple regression analysis for sense of belonging (29% variance explained) included race/ethnicity, perceptions of academically and socially supportive climates in the residence hall, perceptions of a positive campus racial climate, academic self-confidence, academic class year, socializing with friends from home, and participation in a STEM-related living-learning program. Partial correlation analyses indicated that perceptions of a positive campus racial climate were significantly correlated to sense of belonging for Black/African American, Multiracial/Multiethnic, and Asian Pacific American women. Findings supported the application of college impact theories with a transformative perspective to the experiences of women of color in STEM. The regression model supported the salience of campus racial climate perceptions to sense of belonging for women in STEM; however the relationship between STEM living-learning programs and sense of belonging requires further study. Results identified the salience of the campus racial climate and sense of belonging for women of color in STEM, the significance of the residence hall climate to sense of belonging, and the need for racial/ethnic diversity among STEM living-learning program participants. Results are important given the growing enrollments of women of color in higher education and the need to expand access to STEM careers.","2007","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2018-06-25 16:14:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dominant framework in STEM education is the pipeline which assumes girls in general lack motivation and interest to persist in STEM fields. Recent public discourse shifts to address institutionalized discrimination and systemic barriers in STEM culture that filter out underrepresented populations. Informal education or complementary learning STEM programs offer alternative opportunities for students to explore outside of rigid school academic and social systems. Few articles look specifically at STEM complementary learning programs, and even fewer focus on the effects on girls of color. This research is a quantitative study to categorize existing mission statements and training behind organizations that provide STEM programs. The results will provide a better understanding of the relationship between practices of STEM education organizations and the programs they create. Diversity training and inclusive language in mission statements had weak correlations with increased cultural responsiveness in the program offerings. The results suggest organizations must be more intentional and explicit when implementing diversity goals.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2018-06-25 16:14:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this study, diversity is defined as more than the personal identities an individual may identify with (i.e. race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc.). Diversity may also include a person’s background or cultural upbringing, how a person thinks, and how a person behaves. The overarching research question for this study was: How do STEM tenured faculty members understand and engage diversity in routine day to day duties? Twelve tenured faculty participants representing a variety of professional STEM backgrounds (engineers, mathematicians, etc.), personal identities (race, gender, etc.), and academic positions (department heads, associate deans, etc.) participated in individual interviews (twenty four contact hours). During the interview process, the participants shared stories about their lived experiences as faculty members and also how they engaged diversity in their everyday work activities. The theoretical framework, Huston’s “faculty vitality,” was integrated with Saldana’s verbal exchange coding to provide better analysis and interpretation of faculty member’s experiences. The participants’ stories were analyzed through the framework which organized their engagement in diversity in three of the four dimensions: 1) Intellectual exchange and collaboration- the healthy sharing of ideas among colleagues; 2) Decision making processes- decisions that have an impact on the work environment and also impacts others (faculty and students); and, 3) Mentoring relationships-helping junior faculty members establish themselves and transition through different facets of their professional lives (Huston, et al.2007). The findings indicate that faculty of color, women faculty, and faculty that identify as GLBT framed their engagement in intellectual exchange and collaboration in diversity through their personal identities while white male faculty framed their engagement through their personal lens of their professional background and position or rank. This finding indicates that lived experience and identities inform faculty engagement in diversity issues, as well as the university type and the culture of the discipline. In decision making processes for diversity, tenured faculty reported that they struggle with an internal battle whether they should try to fit in the academic culture or fight for others while pushing against the academic culture. Depending on faculty’s experience, faculty members decided to either address the issue of diversity or attempt to fit in the academic culture. The final major finding is that every participant understood mentoring was important and that mentoring for diversity can be complicated. In mentoring relationships each person may not share identities, but they must desire success of the mentee, particularly if the mentee is a diversity hire. Study recommendations and implications included: to improve intellectual exchange and collaborations for diversity, leaders at research universities and PWIs need to gather how their faculty understand diversity to inform them how to initiate diversity activities and hold faculty accountable for enhancing diversity. For decision making processes for diversity, leaders can be more intentional in making core cultural changes that cultivate a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Suggested core cultural changes may include changing how institutions assess how faculty qualify for tenure, reconsider using standardized exams for assessing how potential graduates enter academic programs, and have unified processes that include how diversity is important to incoming faculty across the institutions in departmental hiring processes. To improve mentoring relationships for diversity, departments can be more comprehensive in coaching faculty to examine their privilege and consider how it can be used to enhance diversity within their disciplines and their departments.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2019-10-23 13:44:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this fact, this demographic group is increasingly recognized at the national level as a key source of underutilized talent that may significantly contribute to the nations' STEM talent pool. As a result, resources continue to be allocated to higher education institutions to support the successful career advancement of women of color in STEM. Yet, little empirical data currently exists about how these faculty members successfully navigate the promotion and tenure process based on the salient challenges they face as probationary faculty. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that contribute to the successful career advancement of tenured Black women and Hispanic/Latina STEM faculty from assistant to associate professors at predominately White, research institutions. A sub-focus of this study is to identify the challenges faced by the participants during their early career. This qualitative study is guided by social cognitive theory and the literature on faculty development. A purposeful snowball sampling technique (n=13) is utilized. Respondents filled out an online demographic questionnaire and participated in one round of telephone interviews (90-120 minutes). The findings show that the participants faced five key challenges as probationary, early career faculty. Seven personal and external strategies enabled the participants to mitigate these challenges and contributed to their successful promotion and tenure.

One set of analyses tested a mediational model in which features of the STEM peer climate predicted girls' and women's identification with STEM, which in turn predicted their intent to remain in STEM. Another set of analyses examined the prevalence of sexism in STEM and assessed whether peer support might be especially beneficial for girls and women who have experienced sexism. Across all analyses, particular attention was paid to differences that were driven by participants' phase of education. The sample included STEM-oriented girls and women in high school (n = 134), college ( n = 125), and graduate school (n = 102) who completed a survey online or in person. Analyses carried out with path analysis generally supported the hypothesized mediational model. Also, in partial support of hypotheses, women who were pursuing STEM undergraduate majors reported experiencing more sexism than did their counterparts in high school and graduate school. Lastly, as hypothesized, the association between peer support and the intent to remain in STEM was especially strong among girls and women who had experienced sexism.

It has become clear that increasing the representation of women will require multifaceted changes across all components related to a career in STEM. One area that has received little attention has been the role of professional research organizations on the careers of female and male faculty. Memberships in professional research organizations are typical for professors at research universities, yet little is known about experiences within these organizations. The studies in this dissertation tested whether 1) commitment to professional research organizations relate to career satisfaction, 2) women are underrepresented in the most prestigious positions in research organizations, 3) women differ from men in their views of membership benefits and factors limiting participation in these organization, and 4) an organization's characteristics are impacting member views of gender equity. Reports from faculty currently holding tenure-track positions in a sample of 41 research universities across the U.S. revealed that affective commitment to a research organization was positively related to career satisfaction for women and men. There were mixed results when examining whether involvement levels differed by gender. Women and men rated the importance of membership benefits similarly but women consistently recognized less equitable treatment based on gender. Leaders of 21 research organizations identified policies used to address issues potentially limiting the involvement of their female members. The number of policies reported was inversely related to perceptions of gender equity for female members. Male members of these organizations reported greater perceptions of gender equity when the organization had a higher proportion of female leaders and speakers at conferences. The distinct gender differences in how gender equity was perceived and influenced by organization-level characteristics illustrates the need to carefully consider what changes are being implemented and how those changes may differentially impact men and women. Together these data contribute to the understanding of women's experiences in STEM and demonstrate the need to initiate purposeful and informed changes within professional research organizations.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:43","2018-06-25 16:14:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet women remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (AAUW, 2010). Underrepresentation persists despite several decades of research, legislation, and intervention focused on gender equality in STEM fields (Clewell, 2002). The underrepresentation or shortage of women in STEM fields is identifiable primarily in degree attainment, in workforce demographics, and in a gender wage gap. Situated in constructivist grounded theory, this study asks how do women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, particularly those in established career positions, persist when encountering personal and institutional barriers, resistance, and hostility? I use an interpretive-constructivist lens to conduct a grounded theory study exploring the experiences of women who persist in STEM fields, their relation to extant literature on this topic, and the connections to K-12 education practices, specifically curriculum. To understand the connections to curriculum I employ Pinar’s (2012) method of currere. Pinar (2012) contends currere “provides a strategy for students of curriculum to study the relations between academic knowledge and life history in the interests of self-understanding and social reconstruction"" (p.44). This qualitative study explored nine female STEM workers stories of persistence as each respondent works in STEM fields were gender parity has yet to be established. This study presents a substantive theory: As women persist in STEM fields they reframe themselves to be situated in the overlapping intersection of the social processes that correspond to “engagement” and “persistence.” This reframing is possible by interpreting one’s present day circumstances by independently removing oneself from current circumstances to understand the cumulative effect of both past and present. The findings highlight the importance of early educative experiences and their reinforcement throughout formal education including the STEM pipeline. The findings suggest that how one understands and interprets STEM work, and the compatibility ones’ own identity with this work are crucial, reinforcing the some of the diverse body of literature that seeks to understand women’s underrepresentation in STEM. Although literature focused on STEM related education, including work examining gender, offers suggestions compatible with the findings of this study, experiences that are match the stories of the respondents appear to be outside of the norm.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:44","2018-06-25 16:14:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research investigates the extent to which anticipated conflicts between work and family life (AWFC) are negatively related to students’ embeddedness in their STEM majors, especially the STEM embeddedness of women. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling in Mplus-7 with a sample of 218 STEM students from an archival database. As hypothesized, work-family decision making self-efficacy had a negative relationship with both anticipated work interference with family (AWIF) and anticipated family interference with work (AFIW). Notably, only AFIW was negatively related to major embeddedness and only the indirect effect of WFSE on major embeddedness through AFIW was positive and significant, partially supporting each corresponding hypothesis. Additionally, the relationships among study variables did not significantly differ by gender. However, the relationship between AFIW and major embeddedness approached significance for women.

This study sought to fill the gap in the literature by examining how AAW described and made meaning of lived STEM educational experiences during doctoral degree completion in the context of the intersection of being African American and a woman. This study utilized a theoretical perspective based upon three theories: (a) critical race theory as a framework to gather AAW's narratives about STEM doctorate education, (b) Black feminist thought as a framework to view the intersection of being African American and a woman in the United States, and (c) the science identity model as a framework to view how women of color successfully complete scientific graduate degrees. Participants revealed that being an African American and a woman in a STEM doctoral program often complicated an already difficult process of completing the doctoral degree. The participants described the educational experience as challenging, particularly the writing of the dissertation. The challenges that the participants faced were due to various factors such as difficult advisor/advisee relationships, tedious writing and revision processes, politics, and lack of information regarding the doctoral degree process. The findings suggested that AAW participants confronted intrinsic bias while completing STEM doctoral degrees, which led to isolation and feelings of being an impostor—or feelings of not belonging in scientific studies. The findings also indicated that the women in this study ascribed success in dissertation writing and degree completion to one or more of the following attributes: (a) having a clear plan, (b) taking ownership of the writing process, (c) having an engaged advisor, (d) learning the writing style of the advisor, (e) understanding the temperament of the advisor, (f) personal will or self-motivation to finish, and (g) actively seeking support. Results also showed that despite being ""one of the only ones,"" the AAW of this study utilized support networks and demonstrated resiliency and self-efficacy to reach doctoral degree completion.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:44","2018-06-25 16:14:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants included men and women who a) identified as either in STEM or not identified as in STEM and b) commented through Facebook on HuffPost Women articles about women in STEM. The analysis indicated that sexism remains an issue for women in STEM careers. Women in STEM identified several gender-based challenges that they have experienced; some participants discussed how they handled those challenges. Men both in and not in STEM were less likely to acknowledge and more likely to deny that sexism was a problem for women in STEM than were women participants. Though findings showed a high rate of supportive commentary from women, they also showed a substantial number of male commenters displaying overt sexism. The analysis helped identify a new form of sexism to the literature on subtle sexism: Threat to Masculinity. More specifically, both men and women were found to display overt sexism to men who supported women by utilizing gender based stereotypes to validate their claims and police gender roles. Findings from this study support the literature suggesting that sexism remains an issue that needs to be addressed; the analysis begins to build a theory about how such sexism is portrayed through social media commentary as an important arena of social and cultural debate.

Broken out by gender and race, the picture becomes more nuanced, with the ratio of females to males receiving bachelor's degrees in computer science higher for non-White ethnic groups than for Whites. This dissertation explores the experiences of university women differing along the axis of race, class, and culture who are considering majoring in computer science in order to highlight how well-prepared women are persuaded that they belong (or not) in the field and how the confluence of social categories plays out in their decision. This study focuses on a university seminar entitled ""Women in Computer Science and Engineering"" open to women concurrently enrolled in introductory programming and uses an ethnographic approach including classroom participant observation, interviews with seminar students and instructors, observations of students in other classes, and interviews with parents of students. Three stand-alone but related articles explore various aspects of the experiences of women who participated in the study using Rom Harré's positioning theory as a theoretical framework. The first article uses data from twenty-two interviews to uncover how interactions with others and patterns in society position women in relation to a computer science major, and how these women have arrived at the point of considering the major despite messages that they do not belong. The second article more deeply explores the cases of three women who vary greatly along the axes of race, class, and culture in order to uncover pattern and interaction differences for women based on their ethnic background. The final article focuses on the attitudes and expectations of the mothers of three students of contrasting ethnicities and how reported interactions between mothers and daughters either constrain or afford opportunities for the daughters to choose a computer science major.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:44","2018-06-25 16:14:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifteen women who received a computer science bachelor's degree from a major research university in the Pacific Northwest were longitudinally studied using a qualitative study format. The study design consisted of a series of interviews and observations during the women's senior year of college and a career interview four to five years later. The effects of sponsorship and stereotype threat on the participants' initial decision to study computer science and their experiences as computer science majors were explored, as well as the ways in which these women's undergraduate experiences influenced their post-college career pathways. The results indicate that sponsorship had a significant positive impact on the women's initial matriculation in the computer science major and that stereotype threat was prevalent but not a deterrent to the women's study of computer science, at times even acting as a motivating force. The women often encountered issues with self-confidence in college and in the workplace; personal motivation, conversely, helped them to persist, both in college and in the workplace. When they embarked on computer science-related careers, the women frequently contended with gendered expectations of behavior in the workplace, in both academic and corporate settings. Understanding women's experiences with computer science, both in college and in their subsequent careers, can help us appreciate why and how women succeed in the field of computer science, which in turn can help to inform both women interested in computer science majors and/or careers and those interested in helping them achieve these goals.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:44","2018-06-25 16:14:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Utilizing phenomenological methodology, this study seeks to understand the essence of women’s decisions to enter into STEM fields and further describe how the decision-making process varies for women in high female enrollment fields, like biology, as compared with low enrollment fields like, computer science and engineering. Using Bloom's 3-Stage Theory, this study analyzes how relationships, experiences and barriers influenced women towards, and possibly away, from STEM fields. An analysis of women's experiences highlight that support of family, sustained experience in a STEM program during high school as well as the presence of an influential teacher were all salient factors in steering women towards STEM fields. Participants explained that influential teacher worked individually with them, modified and extended assignments and also steered participants towards coursework and experiences. This study also identifies factors, like guidance counselors as well as personal challenges, which inhibited participant's path to STEM fields. Further, through analyzing all six participants’ experiences, it is clear that a linear model, like Bloom's 3-Stage Model, with limited ability to include potential barriers inhibited the ability to capture the essence of each participant's decision-making process. Therefore, a revised model with no linear progression which allows for emerging factors, like personal challenges, has been proposed; this model focuses on how interest in STEM fields begins to develop and is honed and then mastered. This study also sought to identify key differences in the paths of female students pursuing different majors. The findings of this study suggest that the path to computer science and engineering is limited. Computer science majors faced few, if any, challenges, hoped to use computers as a tool to innovate and also participated in the same computer science program. For female engineering students, the essence of their experience focused on interaction at a young age with an expert in an engineering-related field as well as a strong desire to help solve world problems using engineering. These participants were able to articulate clearly future careers. In contrast, biology majors, faced more challenges and were undecided about their future career goals. These results suggest that a longitudinal study focused on women pursuing engineering and computer science fields is warranted; this will hopefully allow these findings to be substantiated and also for refinement of the revised theoretical model.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:44","2018-06-25 16:14:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently there is a significant lack of professionals in STEM fields in the United States. Specifically, women are underrepresented in STEM fields, despite making up half of the workforce. Career interests are often developed in the middle school years; thus increase the pool of STEM professionals, it is necessary to spark interest in STEM at an early age. A Game based learning (GBL) approach was used to increase interest in STEM for middle school females. GBL is an effective approach as it utilizes gameplay with educational content to create and engaging environment where students can practice concepts in a real world context. However, computer and video games have historically portrayed females in stereotypical and unhelpful ways. As a result many of female gamers are hesitant from playing certain games, experience negative gaming experiences when they do play certain games, and detracts from the number of female gamers. Thus before any game could be developed, first developed game design requirements that would result in games that are welcoming to girls as well as effective in its learning goals. Based on these requirements, the game Sorceress of Seasons (SOS) was developed to teach the concepts of variables, lists (arrays), and if statements. The game was then assessed with a group of middle school children in an evaluation. The goal of the evaluation was to verify that the requirements created a game that was welcoming to girls, that the game was effective in teaching some basic programming concepts, that exposure to the game increased interest in STEM, and that the gains endured. Students took surveys immediately before and after playing the game. From this, several of the requirements were supported based on feedback from students. Overall, student comprehension in programming concepts increased from the Pre-Experimental Assessment to the Post-Game Survey. Specifically, findings suggest that students comprehend the concept for variables better than the other two concepts.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2018-06-25 16:14:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The twenty-first century presents many new challenges in career development and workforce choices for both men and women. Information technology has become the driving force behind many areas of the economy. As this trend continues, it has become essential that U.S. citizens need to pursue a career in technologies, including the computing sciences. Although computer science is a very lucrative profession, many Americans, especially women, are not choosing it as a profession. Recent studies have shown no significant differences in math, technical and science competency between men and women. Therefore, other factors, such as social, cultural, and environmental influences seem to affect women’s decisions in choosing an area of study and career choices. A phenomenological method of qualitative research was used in this study, based on interviews of seven female students who are currently enrolled in a post-secondary computer science program. Their narratives provided meaning into the social and cultural environments that contribute to their persistence in their technical studies, as well as identifying barriers and challenges that are faced by female students who choose to study computer science. It is hoped that the data collected from this study may provide recommendations for the recruiting, retention and support for women in computer science departments of U.S. colleges and universities, and thereby increase the numbers of women computer scientists in industry.

This study examined the lived experiences of African-American women who completed doctoral programs in physics. Due to factors of race and gender, African-American women automatically enter a double-bind in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (Malcom, Hall, & Brown, 1976; Ong, Wright, Espinsoa, & Orfield, 2011) and therefore, they automatically assume risk for attrition when entering into an androcentric and White graduate program in physics. However, literature on educational resilience has never examined how these women make it through to completion in doctoral physics programs. Using an interpretive phenomenological approach, this study is designed to further investigate the lived experiences of African-American women who graduated from doctoral physics programs. The selected participants included a purposeful sample of five African-American women who had completed a doctorate degree in physics since the 1980s from American doctoral institutions. Data collection consisted of a nine-question background survey, documentation, and semi-structured interviews conducted throughout a one month period. Interviews, lasting no less than 90 minutes, were digitally recorded and transcribed. To ensure validity of findings, triangulation and member checking were utilized. Within this study, the findings answered four overarching questions. These questions surrounded the lived experiences of the participants and how they initially became interested in physics as well as experiences from their undergraduate years. Also, six doctoral obstacles became apparent. These obstacles included gender, race, autonomy, assertiveness, forming study-groups, and passing qualifying and defense exams. How participants overcame these obstacles were revealed through four emergent themes surrounding the social and literal meanings of pluralism. These themes emerged from the data that linked the doctoral resiliency of at least three of the five participants and were categorized as: 1) Forming pluralistic peer connections; 2) Acquiring pluralistic laboratory skills; 3) Utilizing pluralistic problem-solving; and 4) Forming pluralistic support connections. Based on the results of the study, a process paradigm became evident along with three salient conclusions. First, African-American women who want to pursue a doctorate degree must interact with a diverse group of peers and faculty to overcome programmatic challenges, such as the ones previously mentioned. Second, these women must be creative when facing foreseen challenges and utilize strategic problem-solving, even a multi-layered strategy, such as acquiring multiple laboratory skill sets to overcome bias outside of the confines of their doctoral physics programs. Lastly, protective factors have limitation based upon situation and setting. These same protective factors may be unprotecting, or produce negative consequences, if utilized improperly. Suggestions for future research included more in-depth studies of African-American women in physics. First, researchers may want to explore graduate program resiliency utilizing a larger population of African-American women in physics. Next, research on understanding the role of the NSBP in the retention of African-American women in graduate programs in physics may be insightful. Also, studies may be conducted to explore how African-American women in doctoral physics programs partner with foreign nationals, especially the Chinese, to be successful. Lastly, researchers may want to examine life after acquiring the doctoral degree for African-American women in physics.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2018-06-25 16:14:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This translates into a smaller number of female graduates prepared to work in the science career fields and results in American industry looking to other countries for its educated workforce. A mixed-methods research design was used to explore and understand the lived experiences and perceptions of faculty members and working STEM professionals in Northern and Central Virginia. Results indicated that although females are attaining STEM degrees and entering STEM fields in record numbers, obstacles such as a challenging STEM curriculum, bias, feelings of insecurity, lack of female role models, and inadequate preparation for the STEM workforce could impede the progress females have made. This research makes recommendations to the academic community and industry which may be used as retention and recruitment strategies for females considering a career in STEM.

Stereotypes of scientists may be contributing factors in this phenomenon. However, this relationship has not yet been empirically examined. This is partly because of the dearth of literature addressing the stereotypes of scientists and the absence of measures aimed at capturing more current concepts of science and scientists. This research investigates whether undergraduates’ stereotypes of scientists predict their intentions to pursue a career in science. Further, the study examines whether or not STEM academic majors are likely to have intentions of pursuing a science career and whether or not this relationship varies by gender. A sample of 1639 undergraduates, from diverse universities and academic majors, took a ten-minute online survey assessing their stereotypes of science, academic major, and intention of pursuing a science career. Using hierarchical and multiple regression analyses, findings indicated students’ agreement with scientists’ Professional (e.g. whether scientists are perceived as technically competent and logical) and Interpersonal Competencies (e.g. whether scientists are perceived as cooperative and family oriented) positively predicted their science career intentions. The analysis did not indicate that these relationships vary significantly by gender. Further, a one-way ANOVA found undergraduates with STEM majors had significantly higher agreement with scientists’ Interpersonal Competencies than non-STEM majors.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2018-06-25 16:14:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a series of three studies, I addressed the limitations of the current literature on PIC and systematically tested the effects of PIC at advancing stages of education. First, I examined how individuals come to vary in their levels of identity compatibility prior to college. Study 1 examined whether theoretically-relevant experiences prior to college predict PIC among first year college undergraduates. Utilizing a new, less overt measure of identity compatibility, results suggested that high-school experiences with threat and bias negatively relate to girls' identity compatibility, while having adult STEM support and peers who model STEM interests positively relate to identity compatibility. In Study 2, building on the exclusively non-experimental work on PIC, I experimentally manipulated identity compatibility in order to examine its effect on STEM engagement outcomes. Although the manipulation failed to affect PIC, other findings indicated that describing a STEM job as more communal may cause men to perceive female job candidates as more hirable. Finally, although PIC has been established as an important factor for undergraduate STEM women, it is unknown whether identity compatibility would be necessary for women beginning graduate school in a STEM field, women who are presumably both successful and interested in STEM. Results suggested that PIC is indeed important for STEM women at the graduate level and may even buffer them from negative, stereotype-relevant experiences. Together, the present studies strengthen the promising but still fledgling work on PIC and may serve to promote the engagement, success, and retention of women in STEM fields at multiple stages in career development.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2018-06-25 16:14:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used binary logistic regression analyses and the lens of intersectionality to examine whether historically gendered and minoritized identities—including female, racial/ethnic minority, married, and parent of a young child, and the intersectional identities of being a woman who is a racial/ethnic minority, married, or mother of a young child—increased or decreased the odds of early career pathways into academic science for women with a STEM-related Ph.D. Specifically, this study examined data from the 2008-2010 Survey of Earned Doctorates to determine whether holding any of these identities increased the odds of (1) not having a secured position at the time of graduation; (2) among those with a secured position, securing a nonacademic position; and (3) among those with an academic position, securing a position at a nonresearch versus research institution relative to others who held other identities and intersectional identities. Married women and mothers of a young child had an increased odds of not having a secured position relative to others. In most disciplines, higher percentages of women overall, married women, and mothers of a young child secured academic versus nonacademic positions than their male peers, but few identities and intersectional identities were statistically significant predictors of whether STEM Ph.D. recipients secured an academic or nonacademic position, with the exception of gender and female parent of a young child. Overall, most STEM Ph.D. recipients with academic positions secured positions at research versus nonresearch institutions, but lower percentages of women than men had positions at research institutions, and lower percentages of racial/ethnic minority women, married women, and mothers of a young child than women overall had positions at research institutions. Women, married graduates, and graduates with young children had an increased odds of securing an academic position at a nonresearch institution relative to others.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2019-10-23 16:55:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S. education and economic policy for more than 60 years since the Manhattan Project (Bush, 1945; Smith, 1989). For decades, federal officials have introduced initiatives to encourage more students to earn degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with the goal of having them contribute to the U.S. scientific and technological workforce. Yet, not every worker in a STEM job will see his or her career as the obvious path toward job satisfaction and high income. The majority of the literature that documents the rate of exit of professionals from STEM careers has mostly focused on men and women holding degrees from a designated traditional, four-year institution, with some focus on underrepresented minorities (Hanson, 2004; Leslie, McClure, & Oaxaca, 1998; Pearson, 1985; Preston, 2004a; Stephan & Levin, 2005). A closer look at the rate of exit of STEM professionals from a nationally representative sample of U. S. citizens who are women and minorities and who hold a two-year degree may further help education officials create new policies to entice such prospective students to earn a STEM degree, pursue a STEM job, and stay on the job. This study examined the rate of exit of workers from a STEM to non-STEM job from 1979 through 2010 using a subset of the nationally representative sample of 12,686 men and women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). A discrete-time survival analysis measured the rate of exit based on age, region, income, marital status, educational attainment, gender, and race. The research results demonstrate that women and African Americans are more likely than men and non-black/non-Hispanic workers, respectively, to leave the STEM professions that focus on the physical, computational, and biological sciences. For STEM fields that include the healthcare professions, African Americans are still more likely to leave their careers, but women are more likely to stay. Also, the results show that a two-year degree should be considered as a retention tool in the STEM workforce. These findings can further help policymakers and education officials determine the best approach to recruiting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in STEM professions. The results, for example, could provide guidance to career counselors in high schools, community colleges, and universities as they assist students who are deciding whether a STEM career is the right investment for them based on their individual goals, interests, and financial resources.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:45","2018-06-25 16:14:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation explored the pre-college and college level factors that influenced undergraduate women’s persistence in STEM. This study also examined and compared the characteristics of undergraduate women who entered STEM fields and non-STEM fields in 2003-2004. The nationally representative Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) data set was used for analysis. BPS:04/09 study respondents were surveyed three times (NPSAS:04, BPS:04/06, BPS:04/09) over a six-year period, which enabled me to explore factors related to long-term persistence. Astin’s Input-Environment-Output (I-E-O) model was used as the framework to examine student inputs and college environmental factors that predict female student persistence (output) in STEM. Chi-square tests revealed significant differences between undergraduate women who entered STEM and non-STEM fields in 2003-2004. Differences in student demographics, prior academic achievement, high school course-taking patterns, and student involvement in college such as participation in study groups and school clubs were found. Notably, inferential statistics showed that a significantly higher proportion of female minority students entered STEM fields than non-STEM fields. These findings challenge the myth that underrepresented female minorities are less inclined to enter STEM fields. Logistic regression analyses revealed thirteen significant predictors of persistence for undergraduate women in STEM. Findings showed that undergraduate women who were younger, more academically prepared, and academically and socially involved in college (e.g., lived on campus, interacted with faculty, participated in study groups, fine arts activities, and school sports) were more likely to persist in STEM fields. This longitudinal study showed that both pre-college and college level factors influenced undergraduate women’s persistence in STEM.

An examination of three interconnected topics of research will include a history of women in the workforce and identified barriers to STEM education and careers to identify what types of messages are delivered to women as it relates to STEM and how it influences their career interest decisions. While there are historical barriers towards women in training for and entering STEM careers, no strong evidence is identified for sustained improvement. The changing concepts of social cognitive career theory can potentially provide a framework for constructivist assumptions regarding the topic of what can focus Utah young women learners to influence their own career development and surroundings to persist into STEM careers. Interpretative Phenomenology Analysis (IPA) provides increased understanding of the experiences of how Utah young women come to their decision and what role their environment contributes to that experience.

Perseverance of women in STEM is linked to a strong science identity. Experiential learning activities, such as undergraduate research, increase science identity and thus should help keep women in STEM. Most studies on research program development are from 4-year institutions, yet many women start at community colleges. The goal of this study was to fill this gap. Science identity and experiential learning theories provided the framework for this case study at a local institution (LECC). Semistructured interviews determined college science faculty and administrators perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of undergraduate research, the viability of developing a research program, and specific research options feasible for LECC. Transcripted data were analyzed through multiple rounds of coding yielding five themes: faculty perception of undergraduate research, authentic experiences, health technologies/nursing programs, LECC students career focus, and the unique culture at LECC. The most viable type of undergraduate research for LECC is course-based and of short timeframe. The project study advocates the use of citizen science (CS) studies in the classroom as they are relatively short-term and can take the place of lab sessions. The true benefit is that students perform authentic science by contributing to an actual scientific research project. CS projects can effect social change by developing science literate citizens, empowering faculty to create authentic learning experiences, and by sparking interest in science and directing women into STEM careers.","2017","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their voices, interpretation of experiences, and concern with the use of formal education as a mechanism for racial uplift have not been priorities in feminist movements (hooks, 1981; 1989; Perkins, 1993; Smith, 1998; Spitzack & Carter, 1987). Alternatively, Black feminist thought (Collins, 1990; 2000) is a theory constructed by and for African American women. Given the consequences of pursuing formal education in the histories of African American women and the paucity of African American women represented in STEM fields, the purpose of this study was to (a) reveal how African American women conducting research in STEM disciplines accomplished their professional goals, (b) learn how the women negotiated their multiple identities (i.e. race, gender, and class), (c) link the history of educational experiences among African Americans with agendas for social justice, (d) understand how African American women in STEM align their personal accomplishments with broader agendas for activism in higher education, and (e) discover whether there is a collective identity that successful African American women in STEM share. Using Black feminist thought (Collins, 1986; 2000) and narrative analysis of semi- interviews with eight African American women in STEM, the findings from this study revealed: (a) the women in this study described the challenges of pursuing a career in STEM from a feminist perspective, identifying gender as more significant than race; (b) the women in this study experienced more positive interactions with Black male, White female, and White male mentors than with Black female mentors; (c) the women in this study described the use of empowering strategies for overcoming obstacles in their academic pathways; and (d) their collective academic identities were formed by early interactions with members of their academic communities and early exposure to the cultural norms of their academic disciplines. These findings have implications for how Black feminist thought explicates the complex, assorted experiences of highly successful African American women in STEM and how the social construction of academic identities evolves during the course of formalized education.","2012","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some African American women depart science majors, due to school tracking or the leaky pipeline (Blickenstaff, 2005; Bowen, et al., 2009; Jordan, 2006; Oakes, 2005; Rist, 2002). Those African American women who are able to commit to hard science majors have positive self-concepts and form science identities (Gilmartin, Li, & Aschbacher, 2006; Hill, Pettus, & Hedin, 1990; Jordan, 2006). However, these ongoing problems in the previous literature serve as explanations for the underrepresentation of African American women in hard science majors at PWIs. This multiple case research study addresses the gap in the literature on women in STEM fields by employing Black Feminist Thought (see Collins, 2000) along with the concepts of cultural capital (see Bourdieu, 1984, Yosso, 2006), commitment (Locke, Latham, & Erez, 1988), and science identity formation (see Carlone & Johnson, 2007) to examine the persistence of 16 African American women pursuing hard science majors. Using interviews and journal entries, this multiple case research study explored the differences in availability of resources, access to cultural capital, science identity formation, and adversity faced by undergraduate African American women pursuing hard science majors. The main findings from this study were that African American women who persisted in hard science majors had individual interests, support from the home environment, took high school math or science courses that aligned with Town University's introductory level math and/or science classes. They also learned how to navigate through the science curriculum and committed to the hard science major or a career in a STEM field. Forming partial science identities and having access to traditional and non-traditional forms of cultural capital explained why some African American women remained in hard science majors as well. By overcoming adversity in the science culture, some African American women persisted and thus committed to engaging in hard science majors at Town University. This research contributes to the field of higher education by informing policymakers and researchers about some approaches to facilitate the retention and graduation of African American women in hard science majors throughout the K-16 pipeline. Additionally, it, enriches the literature by employing multiple frameworks (e.g., Black Feminist Thought, cultural capital, science identity formation, commitment) to understand the persistence of African American women in science majors at Town University. Future research studies might examine the persistence of other underrepresented students across multiple institutions in hard science majors using qualitative and quantitative methods.","2012","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although equitable gender representation is progressing in most fields, much less information is available on why institutions are still lagging in workforce diversity, a problem which can be lessened by hiring African American women in computer technology-related fields. The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of African American female faculty about race underrepresentation in higher education. The critical race theory and Black feminist thought theory provided the conceptual framework of this study. Using a phenomenological approach, the primary data source was the interview. The sample was comprised of 8 African American faculty women from 1 southwestern state. Data were analyzed using a combined process of open coding, categorizing, and comparison for similarities and emerging themes. Nine themes emerged from the data: negotiating employment in higher education, academic preparation in technology, continuing education and professional advancement, race and gender discrimination, monetary and financial incentives, personal and informal support systems, mentoring and networking, recruitment and hiring practices, and leadership and administrative roles. This study illuminated the challenges that 8 African American women faculty in higher education faced on their career paths in technology related fields. The study can contribute to positive social change by raising awareness in teaching administrators of hiring, promotion, and tenure practices that can help to increase diverse female faculty in computer technology disciplines.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It investigates how familial factors and science identity formation characteristics influence persistence in STEM while considering the duality of African American women's status in society. This phenomenological study was designed using critical race feminism as the theoretical framework to answer the following questions: 1) What role does family play in the experiences of African American women undergraduate STEM majors who attended two universities in the UNC system? 2) What factors impact the formation of science identity for African American women undergraduate STEM majors who attended two universities in the UNC system? Purposive sampling was used to select the participants for this study. The researcher conducted in-depth interviews with 10 African American female undergraduate STEM major from a predominantly White and a historically Black institution with the state of North Carolina public university system. Findings suggest that African American families and science identity formation influence the STEM experiences of the African American females interviewed in this study. The following five themes emerged from the findings: (1) independence, (2) support, (3) pressure to succeed, (4) adaptations, and (5) race and gender. This study contributes to the literature on African American female students in STEM higher education. The findings of this study produced knowledge regarding policies and practices that can lead to greater academic success and persistence of African American females in higher education in general, and STEM majors in particular. Colleges and universities may benefit from the findings of this study in a way that allows them to develop and sustain programs and policies that attend to the particular concerns and needs of African American women on their campuses. Finally, this research informs both current and future African American female STEM students so that they might benefit from the knowledge of the experiences of others in STEM-related fields. As a result, other African American female students might be enlightened by these stories and have the confidence to pursue a STEM degree of their own.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Living-learning communities represent one strategy to help address low persistence for women in undergraduate STEM majors. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate women who formerly participated in a Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) living-learning community while attending a southeastern public research university and to examine how their experiences as a minority in STEM influenced their decision to persist in their intended STEM major. The study employed a feminist standpoint theory lens and used narrative inquiry as the methodological strategy. Specifically, the study sought to answer three research questions: 1) What were women’s experiences as a member of WISE? 2) What are women’s perceptions about why they persisted in STEM degree programs? 3) What are women’s perceptions about STEM fields of study? Data were collected using in-depth interviews and journal reflections. Themes that emerged from the women’s stories provide insight into what experiences were meaningful to them and how their experiences shaped the decision to stay in their STEM majors. Themes included ideas such as support systems as survival kits; perception matters—stepping stones vs. stumbling blocks; and today’s STEM professions, different than yesterday’s. Overall, the women in this study chose to view their experiences as minorities in STEM in a more positive way, which plays a significant role in their success of overcoming barriers in STEM as presented in the literature. That the participants’ positive outlook may impact their persistence is a meaningful finding that has practical implications. The findings from this study suggest that higher education administrators should consider implementing policies that encourage faculty to interact with female undergraduates outside of the classroom as well as implementing components the participants deemed important in multiple campus units or programs. Faculty should incorporate more inclusive teaching pedagogies into their classes—specifically assignments or activities that encourage or require collaboration and fewer that result in one student’s grade taking from another. Also, WISE-like living-learning communities could benefit by providing monthly calendars that include program-specific events as well as the larger campus events; collaborating with other units on campus connected to their theme or mission; and increasing the interaction between women participants and women STEM professionals. In addition to practical implications, the results from this study offer a few theoretical implications. Feminist standpoint theory was not as useful in understanding the experiences of the women in this study because they did not talk about issues of oppression and discrimination as much as that theoretical framework suggests. Instead, the women chose to view as positive those experiences that, with a feminist standpoint theoretical lens, may have been viewed as negative. Thus, positive psychology frameworks may be more beneficial at studying persistence in STEM.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the need for STEM professionals in the United States increases, it is important to ensure that African American women are among those professionals making valuable contributions to society. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the experiences of African American young women in relation to STEM education. The research question for this study examined how experiences with STEM in K-10 education influenced African American young women’s academic choices in their final years in high school. The theory of multicontextuality was used to provide the conceptual framework. The primary data source was interviews. The sample was composed of 11 African American young women in their junior or senior year in high school. Data were analyzed through the process of open coding, categorizing, and identifying emerging themes. Ten themes emerged from the answers to research questions. The themes were (a) high teacher expectations, (b) participation in extra-curricular activities, (c) engagement in group-work, (d) learning from lectures, (e) strong parental involvement, (f) helping others, (g) self-efficacy, (h) gender empowerment, (i) race empowerment, and (j) strategic recruitment practices. This study may lead to positive social change by adding to the understanding of the experiences of African American young women in STEM. By doing so, these findings might motivate other African American young women to pursue advanced STEM classes.

There has been a considerable increase in the numbers of racial/ethnic minorities entering universities. If U.S. colleges and universities are to graduate the next generation of research scientists, they must make efforts to successfully recruit and retain racial/ethnic minorities. The problem is that African American females comprise a disproportionately lower population of the U.S. STEM industry in comparison to other populations. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how critical events within academic and professional experiences contributed to STEM career trajectories of African American women. The study utilized a narrative inquiry methodology approach to explore and gain a deeper understanding of academic and professional STEM career trajectories through lived experiences. The participants of this qualitative study were a purposeful sample of eight African American women in STEM careers employed by the U.S Civil Service. Overall, the despite challenges and barriers, narratives of critical events highlighted positive experiences related to academic and professional career trajectories which consisted of attending college as a non-traditional student, support/mentorship, STEM pre-college preparation, professional career development, and promotion potential. This study sets a foundation for educators, policy makers, stake holders, and Senior Executive Federal employees, to extend collaborated efforts with colleges, universities and the private sector to revitalize strategic plans and policies that increase STEM diversity within the U.S. Civil Service. Expansion of studies focused on investigating academic and professional experiences of African American women in STEM career fields, is recommended to confirm results and to ascertain factors that motivate and increase STEM career diversity.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:46","2018-06-25 16:14:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This qualitative study, anchored in interpretive phenomenological methodology, utilized undergraduate socialization with an overarching critical race theory lens to examine the manner in which African American women in engineering, such as the 862, make meaning of their experiences at predominately White institutions. The findings of the study are important because they corroborated existing research findings and more importantly, the findings in this study emphasize the importance of faculty and institutional agent support, self-efficacy leading to motivation, academic achievement goals and the development of science identities. These factors were significant to the persistence of African American women in this study. Moreover, this study’s findings suggest that these factors must work in concert to be most effective. The findings demonstrated that students need to develop relationships with faculty, administrators and peers. The administrators provide access to resources that assist with persistence and peers are needed for group work and academic support. The faculty relation is most important because the faculty members provide access to information, research opportunities, grades and research and industry contacts. The research also found that the women carried the responsibility of developing and nurturing the relation with the faculty. Moreover, all of the African American women in the study acknowledge racism and sexism however, they responded to these deterrents differently. Some of the women were negatively affected while others chose to ignore the deterrents. However, with the presence of these obstacles, the study validated the notion that these African American women in engineering had a strong sense of self-efficacy which provided a foundation for the women to possess science identities: research scientist, altruistic or disruptive. With these identities, the African American women sought to engage their scientific knowledge further in graduate school, the workplace and altruistically to improve upon society. These findings produce implications for policy and practice, suggesting that engineering colleges commit to transforming academic environments to reflect an atmosphere that is inclusive and supportive of racial and gender differences. This transformation should encompass pedagogy, curriculum, composition of faculty and student populations as well as the academic culture, allowing for a more welcoming and supportive atmosphere, where African American women can persist without concern for proving themselves because of their race or gender.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:47","2018-06-25 16:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several months later, participants who accepted academic jobs rated their hiring institutions on family-friendly policies. Participants in the work-family realistic job preview condition were able to answer declarative knowledge questions about work-family balance in academia more accurately than were those in the other conditions. Participants in both preview conditions experienced a shift in their expectations about academia. Finally, individuals in the work-family preview condition with higher levels of declarative knowledge had a better match between the work-family factors that they originally wanted in their job and what they received.

Critical resilience: A critical race perspective on resilience in the baccalaureate achievement of Latino/a engineering and life science students","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/865318418?accountid=14692","An under representation of Latino/as in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) still persists. In Rising Above the Gathering Storm, the National Academies sounded an alarm in response to data indicating a “troubling decline” in the number of U.S. citizens trained to become scientists and engineers at a time when the number of technical jobs is outpacing the rate of the U.S. workforce. The shrinking technical talent pipeline threatens the country’s future in technology innovation, energy alternatives, national security, and education. This study purported to contextualize resilience and discern the cultural capital and persistence behaviors of STEM Latino/a students succeeding in two adverse environments—higher education and science and engineering. Through a critical race perspective the student cuentos were thematically analyzed. Student narratives were then triangulated with the narrative of the researcher—a Mexican American, first-generation college student, who pursued a life science bachelor’s degree through the two institutions in this study. The theoretical framework was guided by Critical Race Theory, Resiliency, Persistence Theory, and Social Construction of Technology. The study consisted of a pilot survey and narrative inquiry. The survey contained pilot questions on the use and perception of information technologies in STEM education. The narrative inquiry was guided by critical race that enabled both positionality and storytelling through narratives and counter-narratives. Twenty-two Latino/a graduating seniors majoring in the biological sciences or engineering/engineering technology at a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and a Predominantly-White Institution (PWI) in Texas were recruited. The narratives of these students were collected through one-time, semi-structured interviews during the last semester of their studies. Results from the study indicate that these Latino/a STEM students are conscious of their ethnicity; however, they are not critically conscious of the master narrative of what it means to be a Latino/a in a STEM discipline. These students have bought into the master narrative of colorblind science and engineering. The students understood that to succeed in STEM, they had to survive based on their proficiency with institutional norms, practices and cultures and then maintain a sense of self through a respect for their Latino culture.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:47","2018-06-25 16:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This gap is even greater for low-income Latino students seeking a degree in STEM fields. A proposed solution for this gap has been the designation of funding for institutions with high Latino enrollment, known as Hispanic-Serving Institutions. However, little is known about the impact that these institutions have on student outcomes and even less, on how being Hispanic-Serving influences the practices of those who teach and lead within this context. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the ways in which faculty, who were nominated by students, acted as institutional agents for low-income Latino students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at Esperanza University, a four-year public Hispanic-serving Institution (HSI). The interviews of the five students and six faculty members who participated in this study reinforced the significance of student-faculty relationships, as those relationships facilitate the students' integration into the academic and social fabric of the institution. Their stories illustrated the different forms of support that faculty offer their students, which characterizes them as institutional agents. The results of this study affirmed that faculty members are in a position to contribute positively and significantly to the educational experience and success of low-income Latino students, specifically those in high demand fields like STEM.","2012","2018-06-25 16:14:47","2018-06-25 16:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explored female URM college student perceptions of school and classroom climate and the impact these factors had on their decision to persist or to leave engineering. Through a qualitative interview methodology grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), this study explored factors including self-efficacy, perceived barriers and supports, other-group orientation and outcome expectations that influenced students' academic decision-making. Interview participants consisted of 5 female URM students that matriculated into an engineering major at a top tier, private university but subsequently left the discipline in pursuit of another field of study. The perceptions of this target population were juxtaposed with interview data from 4 male non-URM, 4 female non-URM, and 4 male URM leavers in addition to 7 female URM engineering persisters. As a final component in the research design, 9 undergraduate engineering faculty were interviewed to understand their perceptions of why female URM students leave engineering in pursuit of other disciplines. With faculty being a central component of the academic environment, their perceptions of female URM students, as well as how they view their role in these students' retention, provided insight on this other side of retention question. Salient findings emerged that differentiated female URM leavers' experiences in engineering from other student populations. Female URM leavers were less likely to call upon self-directed learning strategies in response to academic challenges. Perceived academic barriers such as heavy course loads, lack of connection between material and application, and perceived academic deficits deterred these students from persisting in the field. A perceived lack of academic preparation also inhibited female URM students from participating actively in class. Additionally, while targeted support programs were effective in connecting female URM students with their peers and such programs contributed to an overall sense of diversity at the school, a lack of diversity was felt when inside the classroom.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:47","2019-10-23 16:59:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In California, the college population is increasingly female and underrepresented minority, a population that has historically chosen to study majors other than STEM. In California, community colleges provide a major inroad for students seeking to further their education in one of the many universities in the state. The recent passage of Senate Bill 1456 and the Student Success and Support Program mandate increased counseling services for all California community college students (California Community College Chancellors Office, 2014). This dissertation is designed to explore the perceptions of female, underrepresented minority college students who are majoring in an area of science, technology, engineering and math, as they relate to community college counseling services. Specifically, it aims to understand what counseling services are most effective, and what community college counselors can do to increase the level of interest in STEM careers in this population. This is a qualitative study. Eight participants were interviewed for the case study, all of whom are current or former community college students who have declared a major in a STEM discipline. The semi-structured interviews were designed to help understand what community college counselors can do to better serve this population, and to encourage more students to pursue STEM majors and careers. Through the interviews, themes emerged to explain what counseling services are the most helpful. Successful STEM students benefited from counselors who showed empathy and support. Counselors who understood the intricacies of educational planning for STEM majors were considered the most efficacious. Counselors who could connect students with enrichment activities, such as internships, were highly valued, as were counseling services that helped students learn to negotiate being a woman in male-dominated classes. The interviews shed light on the particular skills required to effectively counsel underrepresented minority females in STEM majors in the community college.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:47","2018-06-25 16:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This qualitative, case study examined the personal and educational experiences of first-generation Latina women who successfully navigated the STEM educational pipeline earning bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in various fields of engineering. Three research questions guided the study: (1) How does a first-generation Latina engineer and scientist describe her life experiences as she became interested in STEM? (2) How does she describe her educational experiences as she navigated the educational pipeline in the physics, mathematics, and/or engineering field(s)? (3) How did she respond to challenges, obstacles and microaggressions, if any, while navigating the STEM educational pipeline? The study was designed using a combination of Critical Race Theory frameworks—Chicana feminist theory and racial microaggressions. Through a life history case study approach, the women shared their stories of success. With the participants’ help, influential persons in their educational paths were identified and interviewed. Data were analyzed using crystallization and thematic results indicated that all women in this study identified their parents as planting the seed of interest through the introduction of mathematics. The women unknowingly prepared to enter the STEM fields by taking math and science coursework. They were guided to apply to STEM universities and academic programs by others who knew about their interest in math and science including teachers, counselors, and level-up peers—students close in age who were just a step more advanced in the educational pipeline. The women also drew from previous familial struggles to guide their perseverance and motivation toward educational degree completion. The lives of the women where complex and intersected with various forms of racism including gender, race, class, legality and power.

Study 1, a survey of women majoring in math-related fields, revealed that women who believe that status differences between the sexes are legitimate were more likely to endorse gender stereotypes about women's math abilities, which in turn predicted more negative self-perceptions of math competence and less interest in continuing study in one's field. In Study 2, women who tended to endorse gender stereotypes were found to be more susceptible to the negative effects of stereotype threat on their math test performance. The implications of these results for research on stereotype endorsement and women's math achievement are discussed.

Research has shown that occupational segregation and the stereotypes it creates are strong influences on career choice. However, the effects of gender stereotypes on career development are not clearly understood in existing career theories. Social-Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) suggests that career interests and choices are influenced by self-efficacy and outcome expectations, both of which are influenced by perceptions of environmental barriers (such as discrimination and stereotypes). Stereotype threat is a perception that has been found to negatively influence women's performance and confidence on math and science tasks, and has been linked to avoidance of certain domains. The present study explored the potential influence of stereotype threat on women's math and science career self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and interests. Participants included 271 (191 females, 80 males) White, first- and second-year undergraduate students from a large state university in the northeast. It was expected that female students in the stereotype threat condition would report lower math/science self-efficacy, math/science outcome expectations, and interest in math and science majors compared to males in the stereotype threat condition and females in the non-stereotype threat condition. Results of a MANOVA revealed that there was no difference between the responses of females in the stereotype threat condition and the males in the stereotype threat condition or the females in the non-stereotype threat condition. As expected, males had significantly higher interests in math and science careers than females. Stereotype threat did not appear to predict the math and science self-efficacy, outcome expectations, or major interests of the female participants. Regression analyses and bivariate correlations identified some differences in responding between females in the stereotype threat condition and females in the non-stereotype threat condition. A multiple group path analysis offered some evidence to suggest that the relationships among stereotype threat condition, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and major interest differed for males and females. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.","2008","2018-06-25 16:14:48","2018-06-25 16:14:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4LWVAN2S","thesis","2011","Tran, Minh C.","How can students be scientists and still be themselves: Understanding the intersectionality of science identity and multiple social identities through graduate student experiences","","","","","http://search.proquest.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/docview/1158045574?accountid=14692","According to a report released in 2005, titled Rising Above the Gathering Storm, there is a critical priority to develop, recruit, and retain top students, scientists, and engineers to maintain U.S. economic competitiveness in response to rapid globalization. To improve our global competitiveness, the U.S. must retain individuals from diverse backgrounds within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Unfortunately, too few students from underrepresented backgrounds are continuing throughout the STEM educational pipeline. A number of scholars have suggested that students often leave the STEM fields due to conflicts they experience between their emerging identity in science and the other core identities that shape who they are and how they view themselves. For instance, students of color and women often describe science environments with chilly climates for diversity, where instances of overt or covert discrimination are commonplace. The narrow culture of science and the decontextualized nature of science education can also discourage women and students of color because it requires students to detach themselves from any personal interest or relationship they had with science concepts in order to remain rational and objective. In addition, for many first generation college students, it is often critical for them to maintain prior relationships from their home communities, but they can experience difficulties communicating the value and benefits of scientific pursuits to less educated friends and family members. In such cases, these individuals experience tensions between science and their social identities as people of color, women, and first generation students. Whether they persist is influenced by how they are able to negotiate this tension in order to maintain a sufficient sense of identification with the sciences. The results of this study indicated that students adopted specific strategies to manage and negotiate tensions between their social identities and science identities. Among these strategies, it was found that students were able to redefine or reconstruct their own meanings of what it meant to be a scientist and a person of color. Students also developed ways to simplify science in order to make it more relevant and accessible to non-science friends and family members. An additional strategy students commonly utilized was wearing multiple hats, or managing different identities for each given context or situation. By shifting the emphasis or salience of their science identity between science and non-science contexts, students were able to delicately balance seemingly oppositional identity frameworks. For this dissertation, I examined underrepresented racial minority (URM) students, who successfully persisted and enrolled in graduate STEM degree programs, in order to understand the process of science identity development. Focus group interviews were conducted with STEM graduate students during site visits to six campuses across the United States. Students at the graduate level were targeted because they could offer insights regarding the key experiences that permitted them to successfully transition through early education and college to become research scientists in graduate school. The campus sites included two Hispanic serving institutions (HSI), one historically Black college/university (HBCU), and three predominantly White institutions (PWI). These institutions were selected based on their high rates of STEM degree completion among URMs. The proposed study will draw from this focus group data. This study employed a phenomenological approach to specifically capture the lived experiences of students who have successfully navigated the scientific pipeline. I investigated whether students experience conflicts between their emerging science identity and other core identities. For students that do experience identity conflicts, it was important to observe how these conflicts were negotiated in order to maintain a healthy sense of science identity. By identifying strategies that students employ to successfully persist in STEM fields, this study can inform educational practices and programs to support students from diverse backgrounds. Accordingly, this dissertation topic has future implications for issues that are of growing importance in STEM fields, such as experiential learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the link between science and social change. The second implication of this study is that it will address misconceptions of race and gender as a deficit in science by examining the role of student agency in successfully negotiating identity conflicts in academic contexts.","2011","2018-06-25 16:14:48","2018-06-25 16:14:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As yet, few studies have focused on how some groups of students experience, succeed, and persist in university mathematics. And fewer still have provided continued examination of the ways that gender and ethnic identities position students' perceptions of mathematics as field and of the ways mathematics is taught. This study focused on how university mathematics majors viewed and perceived the ways that gender and ethnicity impacted their own and others' experiences in mathematics. Data were collected through 35 interviews and three focus groups with a subsample of participants at a public university in Southern California. Data were thematically analyzed in multiple rounds with an intersectional lens, which resulted in three sets of findings: how mathematics majors perceived gender to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, how mathematics majors perceived ethnicity to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, and the ways the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees were feminized and devalued by students, professors, and the department. These findings suggest that bias around gender and ethnicity in postsecondary mathematics continues, and pervasive stereotypes about ""good"" mathematics students as predominantly European American and male exist. I close with recommendations for sustainable and positive changes that could be incorporated into policy, curricula, and campus support to improve participation rates of both women and Latino/a students.","2014","2018-06-25 16:14:48","2018-06-25 16:14:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"88XB38GN","thesis","2010","Hughes, Roxanne M.","The process of choosing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers by undergraduate women: A narrative life history analysis","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/docview/872912695?accountid=14692","This qualitative study focused on female college seniors and their choices about their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college majors and career choice at the college level. STEM fields have an underrepresentation of women in both the numbers of degrees awarded each year and the number of women participating at the career level (National Science Foundation (NSF), 2007). College is a crucial time to study women’s STEM choices regarding majors and careers because women and men appear to be equally prepared for success in a STEM career when they enter college, but fewer women persist in these majors (NSF, 2007). This decrease in interest and persistence has been a phenomenon that policy makers and college administrators have tried to address. One of the prominent policy initiatives at the college level since 1990, has been single gender living and learning communities where women majoring in STEM fields live together on a dormitory floor. The program of focus in this study will be referred to as WSTEM1 (Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This study had two purposes: first, to understand the factors that influence women’s persistence in STEM as the women move toward college graduation; second, to determine the role that WSTEM (a single-gender LLC) had on women’s persistence in STEM. To address these, this study focused on twenty six women who attended a Research 1 university in the southeastern United States from 2006 to 2010. Twelve of these women had participated in WSTEM and fourteen came from the general university population. All twenty six women were interviewed using narrative life history analysis to understand the influences on their decisions to stay or leave their original STEM major. At the time of graduation fourteen of these women (eight from the general population and six from WSTEM) graduated with a STEM degree and planned to pursue a STEM career and twelve chose to leave their original STEM major and did not plan to pursue a STEM career (six from the general population and six from WSTEM). The research was guided by the Eccles’ (2007) expectancy-value model related to career choice2 and Butler’s (1999) conception of gender. The results of this study indicated that persistence in STEM degrees in highly influenced by three main factors: pre-college and college success in math and science; support from parents, teachers, and college professors; and peer support networks at the college level. The stayers mentioned these factors more than their leaving peers. Many of the participants (both stayers and leavers) identified gender related and non-gender related aspects of the chilly climate within college STEM departments that negatively influenced their STEM career decisions. However, the stayers were able to maintain high expectations of success and see value in their continued participation in STEM fields. This detailed qualitative study will help policy makers and program directors better understand how to increase the number of women in STEM fields by focusing on the factors that affect individual women’s choice of major and early career decisions. As a result, this study will contribute to the literature on improving women’s underrepresentation in STEM fields. In response to the question of how WSTEM affected women’s decisions to persist in STEM fields, this study found that providing access to a female-friendly support group offers some benefits to persistence. However, a female-friendly environment within WSTEM did not always translate into female-friendly policies within STEM departments. All of the WSTEM leavers reported negative experiences within their STEM majors as factors in their decision to leave. Participants’ comments about WSTEM, however, indicated that the program provided a peer support network with even the leavers (5/6) reporting the positive influence of friendships they made through their participation in the program. Drawing from these findings, this study concluded that WSTEM met its goals for the women who fully participated in it. The study, like others (Mael et al., 2007), found mixed evidence regarding the impact of women-only STEM LLC’s on women’s persistence in STEM fields. The study found that three main areas can positively affect women’s persistence in STEM fields: success in math and science classes before and during college; positive experiences with STEM fields and professionals in college; and peer support networks. The final area included both formal peer support networks such as WSTEM or informal groups composed of peers in one’s major.

This implies that: (1) intersections of multiple marginalization (e.g. women of color) within STEM is understudied, and (2) there is a need for a multifaceted understanding (encompassing perceptual, experiential, motivational and social characteristics) of students' perceptions of, and participation in, the STEM disciplines. In this research project, a multi-status, cross-disciplinary survey methodology was used to identify the ways in which undergraduate students perceived, experienced, and chose STEM. It was found that the lack of diversity in STEM has distinct racialized and gendered overtones that impact both enrollment and attrition. Multiple statuses, when contextualized with each other and with disciplinary appropriateness, played a role in students' attraction to and retention within STEM. Additionally, circles of social context—to which parents, teachers, and peers contributed—created divergent academic experiences for women and men, students of color and Whites, ultimately influencing educational and career choices that steered students either towards or away from STEM. Although some status-related hypotheses were not supported in this research, this lack of significance pointed to a vulnerability within STEM: the lack of diversity among students. Small samples of both students of color and female students who were far outnumbered by Whites and males among STEM students may have led to statistic drowning of any status-related differences between those groups. Further study with a larger and more diverse sample is necessary to identify how multiple statuses affect students' disciplinary climate and motivational experiences.","2008","2018-06-25 16:14:49","2018-06-25 16:14:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, while the number of women pursuing college degrees continues to rise, there remains an under-representation of women in STEM majors across the country. Although research studies offer several contributing factors that point to a higher attrition rate of women in STEM than their male counterparts, no study has investigated the role that high school advanced placement (AP) math and science courses play in preparing students for the challenges of college STEM courses. The purpose of this study was to discover which AP math and science courses and/or influential factors could encourage more students, particularly females, to consider pursuing STEM fields in college. Further, this study examined which, if any, AP math or science courses positively contribute to a student's overall preparation for college STEM courses. This retrospective study combined quantitative and qualitative research methods. The survey sample consisted of 881 UCLA female and male students pursuing STEM majors. Qualitative data was gathered from four single-gender student focus groups, two female groups (15 females) and two male groups (16 males). This study examined which AP math and science courses students took in high school, who or what influenced them to take those courses, and which particular courses influenced student's choice of STEM major and/or best prepared her/him for the challenges of STEM courses. Findings reveal that while AP math and science course-taking patterns are similar of female and male STEM students, a significant gender-gap remains in five of the eleven AP courses. Students report four main influences on their choice of AP courses; self, desire for math/science major, higher grade point average or class rank, and college admissions. Further, three AP math and science courses were highlighted throughout the study. First, AP Chemistry was described as a foundational course necessary for the challenges of STEM courses. AP Calculus was considered a course with practical benefits across STEM majors. Finally, AP Biology was found to be a gateway course, which inspired students to continue to pursue STEM majors in college. All three courses were strongly recommended to high school students considering a STEM major. The findings will help grow a larger and equally prepared pool of females and males and help sustain a more even distribution of women across STEM fields.","2010","2018-06-25 16:14:49","2018-06-25 16:14:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the phase one, a literature review was conducted to identify interventions which successfully reduced stereotype threat toward women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Interventions were then categorized into five types based on their common theoretical framework. Phase two was designed to experimentally test the relative effectiveness of the five types of interventions compared to women who did not receive any intervention and men. Although all interventions enhanced women's attitudes toward STEM (all ps < .05), results showed that value affirmation (a writing activity that focuses on self-values important to the target) was the only intervention to significantly improve both performance and motivation of women under stereotype threat.

The purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which high school students who participate in a STEM program from elementary through high school aspire to STEM careers compared to students with similar mathematics achievement who did not participate in the STEM program. Of particularly interest was the effect of the STEM program on female aspirations toward STEM careers. Career aspirations was self-reported one month before students graduated from high school on a school and graduates of the STEM program were compared to graduates with the same gender and a similar mathematics test score. The quantitative, retrospective study found that 58.75% of the students in the STEM program aspired to STEM careers after high school compared to only 40.00% of students with similar academic achievement that were not in the STEM program. Students in the STEM program were 0.47 times more likely to aspire to STEM careers compared to their peers who did not participate in the STEM program. The study also found that males in the STEM program were 0.35 times more likely and females in the STEM program were 1.0 times more likely to aspire to STEM careers than same gender students not in the STEM program. The effect on gender was not statistically significant due to the small number of females in the study; however, the data is important because females in the STEM program were twice as likely to aspire to STEM careers, in particular engineering. The STEM program effectively achieved one of its goals to increase student interest, especially females, in aspiring to STEM careers.","2015","2018-06-25 16:14:49","2018-06-25 16:14:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","PhD Thesis","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that these individual difference factors are reciprocally related and thus mutually develop over time. They are relatively stable at adolescence and meaningfully predict the probability that the students obtained a college degree in STEM approximately nine years later.

In Study 1, college students at two U.S. West Coast universities (N = 293) provided descriptions of computer science majors. Coding these descriptions revealed that computer scientists were perceived as having traits that are incompatible with the female gender role, such as lacking interpersonal skills and being singularly focused on computers. In Study 2, college students at two U.S. West Coast universities (N = 54) read fabricated newspaper articles about computer scientists that either described them as fitting the current stereotypes or no longer fitting these stereotypes. Women who read that computer scientists no longer fit the stereotypes expressed more interest in computer science than those who read that computer scientists fit the stereotypes. In contrast, men’s interest in computer science did not differ across articles. Taken together, these studies suggest that stereotypes of academic fields influence who chooses to participate in these fields, and that recruiting efforts to draw more women into computer science would benefit from media efforts that alter how computer scientists are depicted.","2013","2018-06-25 16:14:50","2018-10-26 20:21:54","","58-71","","1","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","Stereotypes; Universities & colleges; Women scientists; Computer science research; Computer scientists; Women computer scientists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we explore whether women who enter fields that are male-dominated are more likely to switch fields than their female peers who have chosen other fields, as well as whether men who enter female-dominated majors are more likely to subsequently switch fields than their male peers who have chosen a more normative field. We utilize a sample of 3702 students from a nationally representative dataset on U.S. undergraduates, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS 2004/09). Logistic regression models examine the likelihood that students switch majors, controlling for students' social and academic background. Results reveal different patterns for men and women. Men who enter a female-dominated major are significantly more likely to switch majors than their male peers in other majors. By contrast, women in male-dominated fields are not more likely to switch fields compared to their female peers in other fields. The results are robust to supplementary analyses that include alternative specifications of the independent and dependent variables. The implications of our findings for the maintenance of gendered occupational segregation are discussed.

We conducted a randomized and controlled three-step faculty search intervention based in self-determination theory aimed at increasing the number of women faculty in STEM at one US university where increasing diversity had historically proved elusive. Results show that the numbers of women candidates considered for and offered tenure-track positions were significantly higher in the intervention groups compared with those in controls. Searches in the intervention were 6.3 times more likely to make an offer to a woman candidate, and women who were made an offer were 5.8 times more likely to accept the offer from an intervention search. Although the focus was on increasing women faculty within STEM, the intervention can be adapted to other scientific and academic communities to advance diversity along any dimension.

One source of STEM talent loss that has been commonly suggested throughout the literature is the lack of family friendly flexibility in STEM careers. This explanation has been offered as a reason why women are underrepresented in the STEM fields. We test this thesis using original survey data collected from 3,229 college students at each of the 16 North Carolina public universities. Our results indicate that a concern for the potential inflexibility of one’s future career is associated with a decreased likelihood of majoring in the “hard” STEM fields (physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics). However, we did not find gender differences in this effect, suggesting that men and women who are concerned with the family flexibility of their future career are equally likely to be deterred from STEM.","2016","2018-06-25 16:14:51","2018-06-25 16:14:51","","273-292","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Heidi</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also tested gender differences in these relationships. Results indicated that for women, the relationship between gender discrimination (e.g., unequal access to resources) and job satisfaction was mediated by scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; gender derogation (e.g., disparaging comments) was related to organizational sexism toward women (OSTW), which was associated with perceptions of scholarly alienation and a negative workplace climate; these perceptions in turn predicted lower job satisfaction. For men, gender derogation was indirectly related to job satisfaction via scholarly alienation, and OSTW was indirectly related to job satisfaction via both climate variables. Analyses indicated that most of these indirect effects were stronger for women than men. We discuss these results for both sexes and suggest reasons why men’s climate perceptions may be “chilled” by exposure to sexism toward women.

Specifically, gender centrality buffered the link between identity interference and well-being. Gender public regard buffered the association of both negative climate and interference with well-being, and gender private regard exacerbated the link between interference and well-being.

Yet, there has been no growth in the number of female science faculty at postsecondary institutions such as Iowa State University (ISU). From 1993 to 2003, science departments at ISU hired men and Whites 63% and 78% of the time, respectively. Similarly, 16% of women typically resigned after three years versus 4% of men (Litt & Debinski, 2004). In 2006, ISU applied for and received NSF funding to create an ADVANCE Program meant to respond to this lack of gender equity and to promote institutional change. Using feminist theory, I conducted a critical discourse analysis of ISU ADVANCE documents and website to examine the language used to discuss gender equity and women of color. Connected through the interlocking systems of capitalism, patriarchy, and racism, the following themes were revealed: 1) the political economy of equity and diversity in STEM; (2) the maintenance of male dominance and the general status quo; and (3) the ""universal woman"" and the normalization of Whiteness. Here, I focus on the interlocking themes of patriarchy and racism and demonstrate how these systems effectively remove women of color from the discourse of equity in STEM.

In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non-math-intensive fields,with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.

In this study we examine one of the most widespread marketing tools used by institutions of higher education to attract prospective students, the admissions viewbook. Specifically, we provide an analysis of the ways in which gender and race are situated in representations of undergraduate STEM education. Our findings, based on a critical and visual textual analysis of 20 viewbooks, suggest that viewbooks convey strong messages concerning race, gender, and issues of belonging, hierarchy, power, and privilege in STEM.

However, many science fields lack gender diversity. Although fewer women than men pursue careers in physical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (pSTEM), more women than men pursue careers in behavioral science. The current work measured the relationship between first-year college students' stereotypes about science professions and course completion in science fields over the next 3 years. pSTEM careers were more associated with self-direction and self-promotion (i.e., agency) than with working with and for the betterment of others (i.e., communion). On the flip side, behavioral science careers were associated with communion to a greater degree than with agency. Women completed a lower proportion of pSTEM courses than did men, but this gender disparity disappeared when women perceived high opportunity for communion in pSTEM. Men pursued behavioral science courses to a lesser degree than did women; this disparity did not exist when men perceived ample opportunity for agency in behavioral science. These results suggest highlighting the communal nature of pSTEM and the agentic nature of behavioral science in pre-college settings may promote greater gender diversity across science fields.

Findings from this case study of 25 faculty at one research university revealed three institutional processes that constrained their careers: (a) access to and integration into career networks; (b) distribution of labor in the department and institution; and (c) promotion and leadership. Using Acker's (1990, 2012) theory of gendered organizations and subtexts I uncovered systemic inequities that could compromise professional advancement for midcareer women faculty in STEM. Implications for these findings; Acker's theory; and recommendations for policy, practice, and future research are included.

A vast body of research reflects deep concern with the level of information literacy skill development among secondary and post-secondary students. But even when educational curricula mandate skill development, many students are unable to demonstrate sophisticated information searching and critical evaluation skills. The findings of this study, which we based on analyzing information seeking tasks and conducting interviews with students in three biology classes in a large urban high school, demonstrated a similar lack of skills. Pressure on teachers to “teach to examinations”—that is, to focus on substantive content rather than on information literacy skills and information literacy skills deficits among teachers themselves—is a possible explanation for these results. The study is of particular interest to teachers of the curriculum applicable in the study context, but the broader implications of repeated indications of gaps in students' information literacy skills are a significant indicator that schools must assume a larger responsibility for information literacy instruction. Leaving skill development to the post-secondary environment will not ensure that citizens are sufficiently skilled to participate fully in 21st century life, in workplaces or in their personal life contexts.","2009","2018-06-25 16:14:52","2018-06-25 16:14:52","","12-17","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stereotypes can negatively affect the education, hiring, promotion, and retention of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study evaluated the impact of diversity training on university faculty ( $$N = 234$$ ) by assessing changes in implicit associations and explicit attitudes toward women in STEM. Personal implicit associations about women in STEM improved for men, but not for women who already tended toward more positive implicit associations at pre-test. Men were more likely than women to explicitly endorse stereotypes about women in STEM at both pre- and post-test, and these attitudes did not change as a result of the diversity training. These findings suggest that participation in a brief diversity training can improve implicit associations about women in STEM.

Women pursuing STEM occupations often receive messages that they do not belong or are not expected to succeed in the field, which can negatively impact one's academic performance, increase psychological stress, and influence one's persistence within a field of study (Steele & Aronson, 1995; London, Downey, Bolger & Velilla, 2005). Using career construction theory (Savickas, 2013) as a framework, the current study explored factors that contribute to undergraduate women persisting in STEM majors, and whether the environmental stress or lack of belonging they may experience negatively impacts their commitment to pursuing a STEM degree. Career adaptability and social support were examined to shed light on the relationship between identity compatibility and women's commitment to STEM majors. Participants were 225 women who were currently enrolled at a predominantly engineering university and have declared STEM majors. The study hypothesized that there would be positive relationships between major commitment and identity compatibility, career adaptability, and social support seeking. It was also hypothesized that both career adaptability and social support seeking would moderate the relationship between identity compatibility and major commitment. Results indicated that both social support seeking and career adaptability did not have significant moderating effects on the relationship between the identity compatibility measures and major commitment. In addition, social support and identity compatibility were not significantly related to major commitment. It was found that career adaptability was significantly related to major commitment among women STEM majors. Post hoc analyses were conducted to better understand how career adaptability predicts different types of major commitment. Given that women pursuing STEM majors experience unique challenges and barriers, these findings support the use of career adaptabilities as a way to cope with the environmental stress they may face. This finding has implications for the way new college students are encouraged to adapt to the college environment, and strategies to help women graduate in STEM majors.

Among undergraduate women, experiencing the negative treatment of other women in a science setting predicted SSAB, which was negatively correlated with feelings of belonging in STEM (Study 1) and with intentions to continue in STEM after graduation (Studies 1 and 2).

Thirty-one (28 men and 3 women) STEM departmental chairs and deans at a large, public university participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants’ descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women’s attitudes and their “choice” to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM. We argue that the dimensions of high and low responsibility are useful additions to discussions of leadership, workplace diversity initiatives, and gender equity more broadly. To this end, we provide several methodological tools to examine these subtle, yet essential, aspects of how diversity and change efforts are imagined and discussed.

This writing-intensive course emphasizes information literacy and critical thinking skills, which were developed using written assignments, class presentations, multiple assessment methods, and web-based applications. Design/methodology/approach - This paper will review the literature about discipline-specific, credit-based information literacy (IL) courses and outcomes. It will also analyze the INS250 course structure and map ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education to learning outcomes for the course. Findings - The paper finds that, in the absence of discipline-specific information literacy standards, the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education can serve as a starting point for International Studies course outcomes and assessment. Other assessment approaches, specifically student workshops and concept maps, promote student engagement and provide ample evidence of student learning. Originality/value - This article will identify research skills needed by International Studies majors and students in similar multidisciplinary programs. It will serve as a model of how to build a credit-based course with application to other fields such as political science, sustainability, human rights and international business.

Calculus is a necessary step in this pathway and has been shown to often dissuade people from pursuing STEM fields. We examine the characteristics of students who begin college interested in STEM and either persist or switch out of the calculus sequence after taking Calculus I, and hence either continue to pursue a STEM major or are dissuaded from STEM disciplines. The data come from a unique, national survey focused on mainstream college calculus. Our analyses show that, while controlling for academic preparedness, career intentions, and instruction, the odds of a woman being dissuaded from continuing in calculus is 1.5 times greater than that for a man. Furthermore, women report they do not understand the course material well enough to continue significantly more often than men. When comparing women and men with above-average mathematical abilities and preparedness, we find women start and end the term with significantly lower mathematical confidence than men. This suggests a lack of mathematical confidence, rather than a lack of mathematically ability, may be responsible for the high departure rate of women. While it would be ideal to increase interest and participation of women in STEM at all stages of their careers, our findings indicate that if women persisted in STEM at the same rate as men starting in Calculus I, the number of women entering the STEM workforce would increase by 75%.

Although family-leave policies are designed to provide job protection for parents and ensure that faculty can remain productive scholars, it is unclear whether or not formal family-leave policies have played a positive role in areas of academic productivity such as publishing and teaching. This research investigates the relationships between university family-leave policies and productivity among faculty in six fields of science using responses from a national survey of 1,598 faculty at 150 research universities and data from status of women reports and faculty handbooks.

Additionally, Black women are nearly invisible in the field. This qualitative study examined the undergraduate and graduate experiences of twelve Black women mathematicians. A Black feminist framework embedded with a grounded theory approach was implemented Variations were discovered for the women who attended an HBCU versus those who attended a non-HBCU for their undergraduate degree. Mentorship, a supportive program, and study groups were prime indicators that the women attributed to their success. Future implications suggest finding ways to minimize feelings of isolation from doctoral programs in mathematics and allowing further opportunities for mentorship.

In this study, the instructional environments of two alternative engineering programs with consistently high retention rates for female students were examined. Th e two programs were a multi-year, high school pre-engineering program and an all-women, undergraduate engineering program. Both programs reported consistently high retention rates for female students_higher than 90% for female students in the high school program, and 50-70% for the all-women college program. In both programs, female students were immersed in engineering activities in a collaborative and engaging environment. A socio-cultural framework was utilized to identify how the interactions within the learning environment influenced the female students' achievement. The findings of this study revealed that engagement with peers, mentors and teachers were critical to the female students' achievement, particularly for alleviating barriers that might limit their potentials to be successful learners in engineering classes.

Work–family balance emerged as the leading theme, with participants identifying many challenges thereto. As participants discussed work–family balance, they engaged a discourse ofchoiceto frame the challenges faced by female faculty members in particular. We relate the discourse of choice to the persistence of gender inequalities in STEM departments.

This study of college STEM (science technology engineering, and mathematics) students systematically examined the impact of occupation stereotypes and life goals related to career status, family, and helping others on career interest. Participants, drawn from introductory STEM classes ( N = 186, 88 female) at a public university in the Southeastern U.S., indicated their preferences between pairs of occupations that differed in their gender stereotype. Within each occupation pair, one occupation was described as compatible with one of three goals (high salary, family-friendly, and helping others). A 1 year follow-up was conducted on 148 of the original and an additional 52 new participants ( N = 200, 103 female). Results indicated that men showed greater interest in masculine occupations, regardless of the goal affordance of the alternative feminine occupation. For women, occupations with higher salaries received greater interest ratings than occupations associated with helping others (masculine or feminine stereotyped) and family friendly work hours (masculine stereotyped only). For women, family-friendly occupations were rated similarly to higher salary occupations, only in the feminine-stereotyped conditions. Findings were generally replicated at the second time point. These counterintuitive findings suggest the need for research to examine how gender differences in life goals change over the early adult years for women and men in STEM and other fields.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper highlights findings for progressive reference services in the twenty-first century based on qualitative studies and action research conducted by two openly gay library and information science professionals in the University of Tennessee-Knoxville during the period 2005-2011. Findings - Findings reveal elements of the proposed framework geared towards meeting the needs of LGBTQ patrons during the five phases of coming out - self-recognition, sharing with other LGBTQ people, telling close friends/family, positive self-identification, and integration of LGBTQ identity. Originality/value - Minimal research has been done involving reference services for LGBTQ patrons. This paper's original value is in its extended vision of traditional reference that focused solely on information provision to a more encompassing conceptualization and implementation that designs, delivers, and assesses reference services in a community engagement context to develop fair and equitable services for LGBTQ patrons.","2011","2018-07-11 18:43:55","2018-07-11 18:43:55","2018-07-11 18:43:55","401-422","","3","39","","","Progressive LGBTQ reference","","","","","","","English","Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2011","","","","ProQuest","","","<p>Available</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\UAW77TUM\Mehra and Braquet - 2011 - Progressive LGBTQ reference coming out in the 21s.pdf","","","Students; Library And Information Sciences; College campuses; Emotional abuse; Internet resources; Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The TGA, founded by Dr. Aaron Devor, and housed at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, is the largest collection of transgender archival materials in the world.    As an extension of these exhibitions, the libraries engaged with transgender communities in Atlantic Canada. Through this outreach, the intersectionality of trans lives with areas such as healthcare, legal, and government services was evident, and it is a reality that life for transgender people involves navigating these very different, and often bureaucratic and cumbersome, systems. Working with communities as trans allies, libraries and archives play a major role in providing access to reliable and timely legal and health-related information, and taking a position on social justice issues that divide many jurisdictions, such as the freedom to use the public restroom that corresponds with one’s gender identity. The support of transgender culture and resources by libraries and archives is just one way to promote gender inclusiveness, not just in the stacks, but in the wider community.","2017","2018-07-11 18:52:55","2018-07-11 18:52:55","2018-07-11 18:52:55","","","","","","","Becoming a Trans Ally","","","","","","","en","cc_by_4","","","","library.ifla.org","","","<p>cited</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WMUF3DUI\Bail - 2017 - Becoming a Trans Ally Social Justice Work through.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\8FK7C72Z\1640.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, graduates were asked to agree or disagree with thirty-three statements reflecting attitudes toward (1) the ALA position on social responsibility as manifested in official professional documents such as the ALA Library Bill of Rights; (2) multiculturalism and political correctness; (3) the status of women in librarianship; (4) gay and lesbian issues in librarianship; and (5) the treatment these topics received in their M.L.I.S. and M.L.S. programs. Extensive personal data were also solicited, including the subjects' self-identified political orientation, sexual orientation, personal acquaintance with AIDS victims, educational background, and job history. Responses and openended comments indicated that library and information studies and library and information professionals are not ideologically cohesive in their views on women's issues, lesbigays, or the relationship between social responsibilities and professionalism.

To date, discussion of a corresponding male librarian image, general male issues, and the broader topic of gender issues has been minimal within the profession, while serious discussion of gay male librarians and their professional identity has been virtually nil. This study compares the responses of straight and self-identified gay males to an exploratory survey of male members of the American Library Association. The topics covered by the survey include reasons for entry into the field, the existence and identity of a male librarian stereotype, and gender issues generally, including gender stratification of work and sexual discrimination and/or harassment. Self-identified gay subjects share many characteristics in common with the straight cohort, including the identification of a gay male stereotype and some denial surrounding gender equity issues. On the other hand, the tentative findings of this exploratory study raise the question of whether both gay and straight male subjects overestimate the number of gay men in librarianship. The report concludes with an update on gay issues within the profession since the survey was completed, and recommendations for further research.","1996-03-25","2018-07-11 19:26:45","2018-07-17 18:15:11","2018-07-11 19:26:45","11-57","","2","30","","","The Gay Librarian","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","<p>ILL request</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KGPNXS2M\Carmichael - 1996 - The Gay Librarian.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\IJR5ZYJE\J082v30n02_02.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey and analysis serve as a contribution to the ongoing discussion of appropriateness of sexually related materials in libraries.","2016-10-01","2018-07-12 13:45:24","2018-07-12 13:45:24","2018-07-12 13:45:24","151-170","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","<p>available</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\2NP54E6R\Martinez et al. - 2016 - Collecting Sex Materials for Libraries.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NPHR8QHM\01639269.2017.html","","","censorship; collection development; librarian attitudes; sex materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The behaviors and verbal responses of the reference librarians were recorded afterward by the youth on an observation checklist based on the RUSA Guidelines for Reference Behavior.

Based on these experiences, the author became increasingly aware of the stigma often associated with sex and sexuality. Given the likelihood of being asked a reference question that is sexual in nature, he wanted to research what the attitudes of librarians were toward sexuality. Specifically, he examined if these attitudes impacted reference service by exploring the existing literature and conducting his own study.

Because language used for concepts can change depending on who you ask, controlling this vocabulary is a difficult task, though an admirable one. The aim of this study is to provide a sample of language that patrons use to search for these topics. This sample can then be used to update Library of Congress Subject Headings, or to aid in reference interviews when suggesting keywords. This study used semi-structured interviews to gather qualitative data. This data was then transcribed, coded, and compared to existing Library of Congress Subject Headings and Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms. The results of the study imply that the language used by patrons when searching for LGBT topics is different than the language used by the Library of Congress to control access to that information. However, due to the research experience of the research participants, this discrepancy in language does not keep them from successfully performing research on these topics. More research is needed in order to determine a larger statistical sample, as well as to develop broad generalizations about language used.","2017-04-25","2018-07-12 15:31:07","2018-07-12 15:32:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","","","","","IDEALS","","","","","<p>cited</p> <p> </p>","","https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/97437/COLBERT-THESIS-2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EBSCO’s LGBT Life database was used to gather a sample of 4,321 citations from core scholarly journals in the field of LGBT Studies, covering the time period 1974 to 2010. The analysis reveals that, although LGBT Studies as an area of scholarship emerged from the gay rights activist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the field’s literature appears to be firmly rooted in the mainstream academic literature rather than in popular publications or community and activist periodicals. However, the field has a very high rate of cross-disciplinary citation and cites particularly heavily from medical journals and books. In addition to illuminating the citation characteristics of LGBT Studies, this paper presents lists of highly cited books and journals that should prove useful for subject librarians supporting LGBT Studies programs.","","2018-07-12 15:46:31","2018-07-12 15:46:31","2018-07-12 15:46:31","","","","","","","The Citation Landscape of Scholarly Literature in LGBT Studies","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","crl.acrl.org","","","<p>available</p> <p> </p>","; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\HM3Z6MXX\16268.html","https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16268/17714","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I reviewed evidence concerning sex differences in mathematical and spatial aptitude, biases in hiring, funding, publishing, remuneration, and promotion, and gendered preferences. I conclude that the most important causes of underrepresentation appear to occur before women matriculate in college and are concerned with ability-related beliefs, stereotypes, and preferences starting in early elementary school, which by the end of high school have reduced the size of the potential pool.

Significant pre- to post-semester declines were observed in each of five measured motivational factors (Intrinsic motivation, Career motivation, Self determination, Self-efficacy, and Grade motivation), with effect sizes ranging from 0.21 to 0.41. However, in the second semester pre-survey, four motivational factors rebounded, including three returning to initial levels, suggesting that the observed motivational decline is not long-lasting. Analysis suggests that declines are not related to survey fatigue or student demographics, but rather to grades and, in the case of one motivational factor, to academic field.

Of the 17 percent of the engineering workforce that are women, 68 percent are White women [2]. Why does the male-domination of engineering persist? And, why do some fields within engineering remain more male-dominated than others? While there have not been enough systematic studies across engineering fields to determine why some are more male-dominated than others, there is a body of research examining how some STEM fields remain male-dominated (e.g., computer science, engineering, and physics) while other fields have become more gender-balanced (e.g., biology, chemistry, and math) (see [3] for a review). Essentially, the answer is that fields remain dominated by White men because the culture of the field is ""masculinized"" and excludes women [3]. In this article, I will discuss a few of the underlying assumptions that make up the masculinized culture that excludes women [3], [4]. I focus my review on scholarship focusing on beliefs about women's competence, commitment, and leadership. Next, I illustrate how individuals enact masculinized cultures in their everyday interactions and practices as well as how underlying assumptions of masculinized cultures are embedded in policies and procedures. Then, I discuss strategies for making changes to masculinized cultures. I conclude by providing examples of policy changes that facilitate culture changes and equitable work outcomes. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","2018","2018-07-16 18:51:53","2018-07-16 18:51:53","","4-14","","3","21","","","Male-dominated stem disciplines","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\L7MMSWJP\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed 201 college seniors, primarily women and people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here we discuss one section of the longer interview that focused on students’ sense of belonging, which has been found to be related to retention. In our analysis, we examine the intersections of race and gender with students’ sense of belonging, a topic largely absent from the current literature.                   We found that white men were most likely to report a sense of belonging whereas women of color were the least likely. Further, we found that representation within one’s STEM sub-discipline, namely biology versus the physical sciences, impacts sense of belonging for women. Four key factors were found to contribute to sense of belonging for all students interviewed: interpersonal relationships, perceived competence, personal interest, and science identity.                   Our findings indicate that students who remain in STEM majors report a greater sense of belonging than those who leave STEM. Additionally, we found that students from underrepresented groups are less likely to feel they belong. These findings highlight structural and cultural features of universities, as well as STEM curricula and pedagogy, that continue to privilege white males.","2018-12-01","2018-07-16 20:53:42","2018-07-16 20:53:44","","1-14","","1","5","","International Journal of STEM Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoah&AN=45331411&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawn from the ALES14 dataset, a sample of 2938 sixth and eighth grade middle-school students from 11 schools in two purposefully selected diverse areas (Western Pennsylvania & the Bay Area of California) was used for the analyses presented in this paper. These schools were chosen to represent socio-economic and ethnic diversity. Findings indicate that, overall, youth who are activatedtowards science learning are more likely to have affinity towards STEM careers, certainty about their future career goals, and have identified a specific STEM career goal. However, different dimensions of science learning activation are more strongly correlated with different aspects career preference across different STEM career foci (e.g. science, engineering, technology, health, etc.). Gender, age, minority status, and home resources also have explanatory power. While many results are consistent with prior research, there are also novel results that offer important fodder for future research. Critically, our strategy of measuring affinity towards the specific disciplines that make up STEM, measuring STEM and health career goals separately, and looking at career affinity and career goals separately, offers interesting results and underscores the value of disentangling the conceptual melting pot of what has previously been known as ‘career interest.’ Study findings also have implications for design of science learning opportunities for youth.","2018-06-13","2018-07-16 21:00:46","2018-07-16 21:00:46","","1034-1057","","9","40","","International Journal of Science Education","When I grow up","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoah&AN=45734512&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stereotype patterns and social expectations were identified giving insight into gendered world views. Data was derived through picturing. Collaborative picture drawing, as a means to investigate multiple opinions, is a powerful activity that has the capacity to break down barriers of education, language and culture. By use of content analysis on 24 workshop pictures three key areas were identified as significant when determining attitudes towards computing as a career choice for females; gender stereotypes, role models, and media influence. The conclusion determines there are stereotype misconceptions regarding physical appearance, personality type, and digital ability projected onto young females. These can influence their academic decisions resulting in poor uptake of computing science as a career choice. We determine that Computing Science is seen as a male gendered subject with females who select to work or study in this field having low self-worth, a sense of being different, a sense of being atypical, and a sense of being unattractive We further determine that positive role models and positive gender balanced media influences can broaden identities in computing.","2018-11-01","2018-07-23 14:30:11","2018-07-23 14:30:11","2018-07-23 14:30:11","105-114","","","126","","Computers & Education","Females in computing","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\7R8PELCK\S0360131518301829.html","","","Communities; Cooperative/collaborative learning; Gender studies; Media in education; Secondary education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include lack of prior experiences with engineering and computing, fears of failing, not fitting in, or being negatively impacted by stereotypes or impostor syndrome, a desire to contribute to society, and worries about future work-life balance. While women may be more affected by these concerns, Male students can experience them as well. Thus, attempts to address these concerns benefit all students. The most straightforward ways to tackle these concerns are the same as the primary recommendations found in the physics education research literature for increasing student self-efficacy and constitute principles of good mentoring. Foster a cooperative, inclusive, encouraging environment. Talk openly about concerns and mistakes to help students exchange the fear of failure for a drive to succeed. Provide ways for students to gain experience that is lacking. Emphasize applications to social and environmental issues to increase motivation. Be aware of subtle biases and discredit stereotypes. Acknowledge struggles of the work-life balancing act and promote family-friendly policies. Combined these actions build a supportive learning environment for all students. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.","2017","2018-07-23 19:57:11","2018-07-23 19:58:59","","","","","30","","","","","","","","","Boston, Mass.","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WHB5VML9\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many have wondered why U.S. women continue to shun certain STEM fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This study investigates this question and examines the pathways that women and men follow in attaining their STEM bachelor's degrees. Methods. Using NELS 88-00 and the postsecondary transcript data, the descriptive analysis examines gender differences in the three stages of the STEM pipeline: expected college major, first major, and bachelor degree major. The multivariate analysis examines the outcomes of STEM degree attainment, the subfields attainment and the pathways in a series of logical steps. Results. Drawing from the pipeline model and its associated cumulative disadvantage theory, and the alternative framework of revolving door theory, analyses from this study indicate that men are more likely than women to follow the complete persistence pathway to attain STEM degrees, but women are as persistent as men once they expect a major in STEM as high school seniors. High school achievement, attitudes, and course taking are related to the subfields attainment, as well as the pathways of the STEM degree attainment. Conclusions. Taken together, the results are more aligned with revolving door theory and support the contextual variability in the salience of gender to understand gender differences in attaining STEM fields.","2011","2018-07-24 13:59:41","2018-07-24 13:59:41","2018-07-24 13:59:41","1169-1190","","5","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\UMQCNYN9\Ma - 2011 - Gender Differences in the Paths Leading to a STEM .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research focuses on how students navigate what we call the gendered math path and how that path conforms to and diverges from traditional gender norms. Common themes of women's lower than men's self-perception of their ability to do mathematics, along with the divergent processes of doing gender that emerged in men's and women's discussions of their application of mathematics, reminded us of the continued struggles that women have to succeed in male-dominated academic disciplines. Although self-perception helps us understand why there are fewer women in STEM fields, it is important to understand how different forms of application of ideas might add to the diversity of what it means to do good science.","2012","2018-07-24 14:03:04","2018-07-24 14:03:04","2018-07-24 14:03:04","153-174","","2","5","","","Navigating the Gendered Math Path","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NBQTFLTI\Weber and Hodge - 2012 - Navigating the Gendered Math Path Understanding W.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This well documented but little understood phenomenon is a cause of great concern to STEM educators. Based on the available literature on barriers to women's success in STEM, an innovative educational intervention has been developed at the University of Maryland (UM). In the second year of implementation, Research Internships in Science and Engineering (RISE) is designed to facilitate mentoring and role modeling for women at all levels of higher education: from incoming first year students, undergraduates, and graduate students to female faculty members. RISE is a two tiered program consisting of level one, the first year summer experience (FYSE) focusing on incoming first year students and level two, summer research teams focusing on upper-level undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. Developed to address several major barriers that women face in STEM fields, evidence of program impact based on the first year of implementation is provided.","2003-11","2018-07-26 20:59:10","2018-07-26 20:59:10","","F1D-18-23 Vol.2","","","2","","","Innovative educational opportunities for women in stem","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\QZNKDCE9\1264676.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\LUQ8369T\Schmidt et al. - 2003 - Innovative educational opportunities for women in .pdf","","","engineering education; Mathematics; Collaboration; Design engineering; educational institutions; Educational institutions; Educational programs; Employee welfare; Engineering profession; Personnel; Pipelines; Research Internships in Science and Engineering; retention strategies; University of Maryland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33rd Annual Frontiers in Education, 2003.

Women in STEM are underrepresented and more likely to perceive their STEM educational environments as threatening than do men. U.S. Women majoring in STEM fields (n = 579) completed a questionnaire measuring each construct of a model of threatening academic environments proposed by Inzlicht et al. (2009). Supporting the model, greater gender stigma consciousness predicted greater gender-based rejection sensitivity. Gender rejection sensitivity predicted more negative perceptions of campus climate. More negative climate predicted more experiences of stereotype threat, which in turn predicted lower perceived control. Lower perceived control predicted greater disengagement from STEM domains, which predicted lower self-esteem. Differences also emerged between women in male- compared to female-dominated STEM subfields and between racial minority and majority women. This model describes how experiences of threatening environments may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in STEM. The model provides an overview for researchers, educators, and practitioners to better understand the relations among hostile STEM climates, experiences of identity threat, and academic disengagement.

The sample consisted of 20 students in 9th and 12th grades attending a school of choice. Respondents were interviewed using a structured interview protocol. The National Council for Research on Women study (Thom, 2001) found that girls are more successful in math and science programs that incorporate a cooperative, hands-on approach than in programs that stress competition and individual learning. This finding was supported by this study among 20 high school girls in a school whose mission is to improve the access of girls who study and choose careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines. Related studies on the subject of the underrepresentation of girls and women in science and related disciplines raise the question why so few girls choose STEM careers. Qualitative inductive analysis was used to discover critical themes that emerged from the data. The initial results were presented within the context of the following five themes: (1) learning styles, (2) long-term goals, (3) subject matter, (4) classroom climate/environment, and (5) evaluation. After further analysis, the researcher found that factors cited by the girls as contributing to their success in science programs specifically designed to maximize their achievement were: (a) cooperative learning, (b) a custom-tailored curriculum, and (c) positive influences of mentors.","2004","2018-07-30 18:47:11","2018-07-30 18:47:31","2018-07-30 18:47:11","","126","","","","","Girls and science","","","","","Western Michigan University","United States -- Michigan","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\965TU6JA\Johnson - 2004 - Girls and science  A qualitative study on factors.pdf","","","Science; Education; Social sciences; Girls; Ninth-grade; Twelfth-grade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stories of three groups of key players; NASA, Girl Scout National Staff, and Girl Scout volunteers explained the scope and depth of this unique partnership. Common goals between GSUSA and NASA of encouraging girls to seek careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) were studied to determine if the goals were met as a result of this collaboration. Outcomes such as the Memorandum of Understanding, numbers of attendees at workshops, and artifact reviews aided in the collection of data. The partnership between the Girl Scouts and NASA has not been without strife, and barriers such as funding and communication has delayed the goals of both organizations. Nevertheless, a partnership was forged and has grown since its inception in early 2001. Each of these national organizations has its own way of work and its own culture. How then can two such large organizations find the common ground to partner together and create a new culture shared between them with a common mindset? The timeline of how and when the two organizations began their collaborations and the outcome of their partnership was evaluated. Examination of the Girl Scout culture and goals as they are related to science was compared to the NASA goals of introducing more girls to STEM careers. The impact effect of how many different workshops, events, camps with space themes was analyzed. Girl Scout adult volunteers' attitudes and beliefs about science were explored to determine if changes in beliefs occurred as a result of the experiences with NASA. Ultimately, data were scrutinized to determine if the relationship is sustainable and what efforts each organization must take to maintain a high-leveled partnership.","2006","2018-07-30 18:49:22","2018-07-30 18:49:22","2018-07-30 18:49:22","","166","","","","","Science education for girls","","","","","University of Nevada, Las Vegas","United States -- Nevada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\TAFMZKDU\Grisham - 2006 - Science education for girls A partnership between.pdf","","","Science; Education; Social sciences; Girl Scouts; NASA; Partnership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early in our process, we determined that establishing contacts and making visits to select feeder schools would be more effective then mass e-mails and mailings. It was a challenge to find female undergraduate students from smaller Midwestern schools who had considered graduate school. This is where presenting a short seminar on graduate research and careers at these schools made a large impact.

To attract young women to the area of engineering, girls need to be shown how engineering principles can be applied to solve health problems, thereby improving people's lives. The field of biomedical engineering, an engineering approach toward solving medical problems, is responsible for new medical instruments, diagnostic equipment, imaging technologies, artificial organs, implants, and prosthetics. Since 1981, NJIT has offered the Women In Engineering & Technology (WEIT)-FEMME program. This program, geared toward academically talented 4th through 9th grade girls, encourage them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. A thematic unit introduces the students to a variety of engineering disciplines, while enriching their skills and increasing their self-efficacy in STEM areas.

The Center for Pre-college Programs at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has offered a ""girls-only"" Women in Engineering and Technology program (FEMME) since 1981. To test the hypothesis that the positive results of FEMME may be due to good educational methodologies, rather than due to the single-gender environment, NJIT developed the Pre-Engineering Program (PrEP).

The seminar targeted undergraduate women who were co-enrolled in introductory programming at a four year research institution. For approximately $500 per quarter, a staff member and an undergraduate teaching assistant ran the Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE) seminar. The syllabus was shaped by the instructors' personal experiences, and research studies on gender disparity in computer science and engineering. Throughout the quarter we brought in guest speakers, visited research projects, and held discussions. Our activities concentrated on fostering a sense of community, encouraging a wider and more accurate view of computer engineering, and offering a safe environment for discussion and debate. At the end of each quarter we surveyed the students and found that they had uniformly positive reactions to the seminar. The women felt more comfortable in their programming course and became excited about the field of computing.

These workshops are an extension of the Peer-led Team Learning (PLTL) SI. In addition to peer-facilitated problem-solving, we incorporated two components inspired by learning sciences: (1) training in research-based study skills, and (2) evidence-based interventions targeting psychological and emotional support. Here we use an explanatory mixed methods approach to measure the impact of the STEM-Dawgs Workshops, with a focus on four sub-populations that are historically underrepresented in Chemistry: underrepresented minorities, females, low-income students, and first-generation students. Specifically, we compared three groups of students in the same General Chemistry course: students in general chemistry and not the workshops (""Gen Chem students""), students in the workshops (""STEM-Dawgs""), and students who volunteered for the workshops but did not get in (""Volunteers""). We tested hypotheses with regression models and conducted a series of focus group interviews with STEM-Dawgs. Compared to the Gen Chem population, the STEM-Dawg and Volunteer populations were enriched with students in all four under-represented sub-populations. Compared to Volunteers, STEM-Dawgs had increased exam scores, sense of belonging, perception of relevance, self-efficacy, and emotional satisfaction about chemistry. URM STEM-Dawgs had lower failure rates, and exam score achievement gaps that impacted first-generation and female Gen Chem students were eliminated in the STEM-Dawg population. Finally, female STEM-Dawgs had an increased sense of belonging and higher emotional satisfaction about chemistry than women Volunteers. Focus groups suggested that successes came in part from the supportive peer-learning environment and the relationships with peer facilitators. Together, our results indicate that this supplementary instruction model can raise achievement and improve affect for students who are underrepresented in chemistry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.","2018","2018-08-02 18:22:10","2018-08-02 18:22:10","","846-866","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KIMD4SXR\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods A list of academic radiology departments in the United States was compiled using the U.S. News and World Report listing of Best Hospitals for Orthopedics and Rheumatology to aid in department selection. Faculty information for MSK radiology divisions was obtained using websites pertinent to each department. Figures were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges and used as a benchmark for comparison. Results The 25 top-ranked hospitals with MSK radiology divisions were identified, with a total of 215 MSK trained radiologists. Female radiologists made up 33% of the MSK trained faculty (n = 71). This compares to 38% of fulltime female faculty in academic medicine. 79 assistant professor roles were identified, of which 35% were women (n = 28). 34% of associate professors were women (n = 11). Only 23% of professors were women (n = 10); this compares with 21% of female professors in academic medicine. Six MSK radiologists held either chair or vice-chair roles and three of these were women. Of the 24 chief or director roles identified, 30% of these were held by women. Conclusion The proportions of women within various roles in academic MSK radiology are similar to and in some instances higher than corresponding national benchmarks. However, there remains a discrepancy between the sexes with an overall male majority. Awareness of this fact is the first step required to help correct this imbalance.","2018-07-29","2018-08-02 18:23:51","2018-08-02 18:23:51","2018-08-02 18:23:51","","","","","","Clinical Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\SZUWSFCU\S0899707118302109.html","","","Academia; Women; Career; Musculoskeletal radiology; Professor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such obstacles translate to few women entering careers in technology fields, resulting in lower wages for women and limited career opportunities. Gender differences in mathematics and science appear to grow as students progress through high school. In college, fewer females are found in advanced mathematics and science courses. To address these issues, the Pre-Engineering Instructional and Outreach Program (PrE-IOP), a collaboration of the Newark College of Engineering and New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT) Center for Pre-College Programs, was created. This program seeks to increase the future pool of qualified high-tech workers, including women and minorities. PrE-IOP consists of two components: 1. An instructional component that implements pre-engineering curriculum in middle and high school classes. 2. An outreach component that consists of a comprehensive information campaign about the rewards of engineering and technology professions. One project of the outreach component is a series of teleconferences on the theme of ""Building an Engineer"" designed to introduce middle and high school educators to engineering and engineering education. ""Building an Engineer: Women in Engineering,"" our second teleconference of this series, deals with gender issues in engineering education and engineering careers. After participating in this teleconference, educators will be better informed of the shortage of female engineers, the importance of encouraging young women to take advanced math and science courses, and how to help female students build confidence in their mathematics and science abilities.","2003","2018-08-02 18:27:38","2018-08-02 18:27:38","2018-08-02 18:27:38","","","","","","","Building An Engineer","","","","","American Society for Engineering Education, 1818 N Street NW, Suite 600, Washington, DC, 20036, USA, [mailto:conferences@asee.org], [URL:http://www.asee.org]","","English","","","","","ProQuest","","","","","","","Students; Engineering education; Minorities; Barriers; Colleges; Construction; Engineers; Females; Mathematical analysis; Shortages; Wages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most attrition in computer science occurs early in this major, in the freshman and sophomore years, and women drop out in disproportionately greater numbers than their male counterparts. Taking an ethnographic approach to investigating women's experiences and progress in the first year courses in the computer science major at the University of Pennsylvania, this study examined the pre-college influences that led these women to the major and the nature of their experiences in and outside of class with faculty, peers, and academic support services. This study sought an understanding of the challenges these women faced in the first year of the major with the goal of informing institutional practice about how to best support their persistence. The research reviewed for this study included patterns of leaving majors in science, math and engineering (Seymour & Hewitt 1997), the high school preparation needed to pursue math and engineering majors in college (Strenta, Elliott, Adair, Matier, & Scott, 1994), and intervention programs that have positively impacted persistence of women in computer science (Margolis & Fisher, 2002). The research method of this study employed a series of personal interviews over the course of one calendar year with fourteen first year women who had either declared on intended to declare the computer science major in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Other data sources were focus groups and personal interviews with faculty, administrators, admissions and student life professionals, teaching assistants, female graduate students, and male first year students at the University of Pennsylvania. This study found that the women in this study group came to the University of Pennsylvania with a thorough grounding in mathematics, but many either had an inadequate background in computer science, or at least perceived inadequacies in their background, which prevented them from beginning the major on an equal footing with their mostly male peers and caused some to lose confidence and consequently interest in the major. Issues also emanated from their gender-minority status in the Computer and Information Science Department, causing them to be socially isolated from their peers and further weakening their resolve to persist. These findings suggest that female first year students could benefit from multiple pathways into the major designed for students with varying degrees of prior experience with computer science. In addition, a computer science community within the department characterized by more frequent interaction and collaboration with faculty and peers could positively impact women's persistence in the major.","2005","2018-08-02 18:29:26","2018-08-02 18:29:26","2018-08-02 18:29:26","","144","","","","","Sundials in the shade","","","","","University of Pennsylvania","United States -- Pennsylvania","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JHNQ4QYZ\Powell - 2005 - Sundials in the shade  A study of women's persist.pdf","","","Education; Social sciences; Women students; Computer science; Persistence; Selective university","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Likewise, the contributions of women to science, engineering, and technology professions are vital, yet the number of young women considering these historically male-dominated professions remain at unacceptably low levels. The public and private sectors have invested millions of dollars since the 1980s to remove barriers and encourage and support women in the sciences and technological fields. Little or no advancement has been made in the representation of women in the technical field of engineering since the late 1980s (American Society for Engineering Education, 2001). Still, employment prospects for women have increased dramatically in the late 20th century. Yet, in the engineering profession, a profession that holds promise and opportunity for one to positively impact society—the lack of women in the field seems baffling. Studies suggest the lack of academic preparation (in mathematics and the sciences, in particular) is not a feasible explanation for the low numbers of young women interested in majoring in engineering upon graduation from high school (ACT, 2003; Iowa Department of Education, 2002; National Center for Education Statistics, 2000). This study, via a participatory action research methodology [academic researcher and adolescent females], documents the career exploration journey and analyzes how young women (10th-grade girls) came to know the technical profession of engineering. The study analyzed young women's career exploration approach, the influences that dominated their sense of the profession, and their views and feelings about the career option upon the conclusion of the exploration experience. Experiential learning themes dominated the exploration approach, while perceptions of otherness and gendering quickly developed as the young women “came to know” engineering. The extensive and opportunistic nature of the profession was appealing, however, the messages were alienating. Personal choices of the young women evolved around lifestyle and fit. The engineering profession they “came to know” had little in common with their world or future.","2003","2018-08-02 18:52:39","2018-08-02 18:52:39","2018-08-02 18:52:39","","175","","","","","","","","","","Iowa State University","United States -- Iowa","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KUNPTSNA\Bruning - 2003 - How young women come to know the engineering profe.pdf","","","Engineering; Education; Social sciences; Women students; Career exploration; Profession","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do so many women drop out of engineering programs? Why do so few women persist and graduate? What are the experiences that women have that lead them to make their decisions about persisting or attriting from engineering programs? What meaning do they ascribe to their persistence or attrition? Using narrative inquiry and a feminist perspective, this study looked at the stories that women share about their experiences in engineering programs to understand how those experiences impact their decisions to persist or attrit from engineering and to understand how women explain their persistence or attrition to themselves.

Using qualitative methods---two focus group meetings, nineteen autobiographical essays, and twenty two individual interviews, this research focuses on what women learn from their experiences in engineering school, and how they respond to their perceived experiences. This study proposes to delineate (a) the dynamic interaction between women and the social structure of engineering school; (b) women's perception and conceptualization of the social structure they practice; and (c) women's strategic responses to the structure leading to identity construction. Becoming an engineer is problematic for women because the identity of ""engineer"" is based upon hegemonic ideas developed by previous generations of engineers---men. This research explores how women, standing in the borderline of being women and being engineers, account and construct their identities as women engineers.

For Women in Engineering (WIE) programs to be maximally effective, they must have access to validated assessment instruments for measuring the effectiveness of their recruitment and retention activities for women in engineering studies. Such assessment results can provide the basis for the development and revamping of effective activities designed to meet program objectives and missions. This paper reports the development and early results of a survey undertaken as part of the National Science Foundation-funded Assessing Women in Engineering (AWE) project. The instrument is designed to measure undergraduate women students' self-efficacy in studying engineering. Self-efficacy is ""belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the sources of action necessary to manage prospective situations"" z. Prior work from Blaisdell3 has shown that feelings of efficaciousness can be an important predictor in the success of women studying engineering. In our project, we developed a survey instrument designed to measure self-efficacy in engineering, feelings of inclusion and outcomes expectations, and collected responses from undergraduate women studying engineering at four institutions: Penn State University (PSU), Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech), University of Texas - Austin (UT Austin) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). The paper describes the development process for ensuring reliability and validity and also reports the preliminary results of the analysis to answer the following research questions. 1. Do students' feelings of self-efficacy vary from one institution to another? 2. Do students with different year-standings answer the module items differently regardless of institution? 3.

While many Americans regard this segregation as natural and inevitable, closer examination reveals a great deal of variability in the gendering of STEM fields across time, space, and demographic groups. This article assesses how different theoretical accounts accord with the available evidence on the gender composition of scientific and technical fields. We find most support for accounts that allow for a dynamic interplay between individual-level traits and the broader sociocultural environments in which they develop. The existing evidence suggests, in particular, that Western cultural stereotypes about the nature of STEM work and STEM workers and about the intrinsic qualities of men and women can be powerful drivers of individual aptitudes, aspirations, and affinities. We offer an illustrative catalog of stereotypes that support women's STEM-avoidance and men's STEM-affinity, and we conclude with some thoughts on policy implications. © 2018 by the authors.","2018","2018-08-10 18:14:59","2018-08-10 18:14:59","","","","7","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NMXQIBDE\display.html","","","STEM; Science; Stereotypes; Culture; Gender; Inequality; Occupations; Segregation; Work","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This in turn can help enhanced female retention in the field of engineering, whether in academia or in industry.

The podcast, Beyond the (Micro)scope, sets out to provide a creative platform for women in all STEM fields to gain more exposure to media and practice being better STEM communicators. As a result of our podcast interviews, we have found that many of our female guests express lack of confidence in communicating the work that they do. As the interview progresses, our guests often become more comfortable and confident with describing their work and their passion in STEM.

Three hundred and fifty-two undergraduates in USA completed survey items comprising nine factors identified from previous research. Mean gender differences were evident on six of these: Males more strongly endorsed Gender Determinism (the belief that differences between the genders are real, meaningful, and largely biologically driven), and STEM-specific gender stereotypes (that men are better at math and science), and were more likely to report having an influential pSTEM role model in high school; females more strongly endorsed the importance of felt belonging in their academic major, communality goals, and stigma concerns regarding gender. As a set, the factors accounted for a significant proportion (34%) of the gender disparity in selection of a pSTEM major. Significant indirect effects partially explaining the gender gap in pSTEM major selection were evidenced for four of the factors: Gender Determinism, Belonging Importance, Communal Goals, and having a pSTEM high school role model. The findings speak to the unique ability of these factors to predict pSTEM major selection, and gender disparities in these. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2018","2018-08-10 18:16:13","2018-10-26 20:19:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Article in Press","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1080/01443410.2018.1489526","<p>Article in Press</p>; <p>Article in Press</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\7W9NABF5\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\AGH5Z8YF\display.html","","gender differences; Women in STEM; academic major choice; gender ideology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interventions are brief, low cost, and effective because they target specific psychological processes that cause disinterest, disengagement, and poor performance in STEM education. Interventions promoting a growth mindset address needs for competence and confidence. Communal goal interventions portray STEM as fulfilling communal values. Utility-value interventions highlight the usefulness and value of STEM education in students’ lives and careers. Values-affirmation interventions can buffer negative effects of social identity threat by reaffirming one’s personal values. Belonging interventions can bolster sense of belonging and identity in STEM by fostering a personal connection with the STEM community. Role models can instill a sense of belonging and identity compatibility in underrepresented groups in STEM.

Although women hold roughly half of all jobs in the United States, only 24% of STEM jobs are occupied by women. The problem is even more pronounced for engineering, where women held about 12% of jobs as of 2013 (Corbett &amp; Hill, 2015). Consequently, interactive, hands-on outreach programs are a common tool used by universities to encourage interest in engineering from K–12 students. Engineering—Get Into Real Learning (E-GIRL) is a week-long, residential summer program offered by Texas Tech University for female high school students. The primary goal of the program is to help participants make informed decisions about engineering majors and careers. To this aim, the purposes of the program are: (1) to offer a platform for female high school students to learn about the various disciplines of engineering offered at Texas Tech University and other universities; (2) to provide a realistic university experience, including coursework, social, and professional development opportunities; and (3) to provide hands-on exposure to a real-world engineering problem. E-GIRL ran for the second time in the summer of 2016, based on the favorable support it received in 2015. Primary components of this year’s program were a multidisciplinary group project focused on the theme of CO2 capture and storage, as well as a series of two-hour classes taught by university faculty and graduate students in the following six engineering disciplines: chemical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This paper presents the multidisciplinary structure of the program and its connection to the project that was assigned to program participants. The curriculum structure, the in-class activities, and the method of delivery for each discipline are explained in depth. The assessment of the program’s second year, including comparisons to the results from the first year and modifications to the program based on feedback from previous program participants, are discussed. Assessment was conducted through engineering skills assessment questionnaires, which required students to self-evaluate their competence in 18 skill sets before and after the program. These skill sets are qualities often identified to be important for engineers, and encompass traits associated with problem solving, project management, teamwork, and communication skills. Key results show improved self-assessment for most of the engineering skills after the program. Additionally, the skills that did not show improved self-assessment ratings after the program were consistent throughout both years. Qualitative results show a more matured and complete understanding of engineering and the individual engineering disciplines upon completion of the program. Through oral presentations, participants demonstrated in-depth engagement with the environmental conservation theme of the project. The environmental conservation theme is consistent with the participants’ aspirations for considering an engineering career and championing sustainability, which was highlighted by program participants in 2015 as a desired additional focus of the program. Overall, the program provided an opportunity for participants to experience the multidisciplinary nature of engineering, aided participants’ understanding of the roles of individual engineering disciplines, and furnished a realistic preview of student life in a university. © 2018, Purdue University Press.

Following completion of the 4-year grants, the grant PIs formed a grassroots collaborative, the Research Partnership on Women in Science Careers. Objective: To summarize the work of the Research Partnership, which resulted in over 100 publications. Methods: We developed six themes to organize the publications, with a “Best Practices” for each theme at the end of each section: Barriers to Career Advancement; Mentoring, Coaching, and Sponsorship; Career Flexibility and Work-Life Balance; Pathways to Leadership; Compensation Equity; and Advocating for Change and Stakeholder Engagement. Results: Women still contend with sexual harassment, stereotype threat, a disproportionate burden of family responsibilities, a lack of parity in compensation and resource allocation, and implicit bias. Strategies to address these barriers using the Bronfenbrenner ecological model at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels include effective mentoring and coaching, having a strong publication record, addressing prescriptive gender norms, positive counter-stereotype imaging, career development training, networking, and external career programs such as the AAMC Early and Mid-Career Programs and Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM). Conclusions: Cultural transformation is needed to address the barriers to career advancement for women. Implementing the best practices noted of the work of the Research Partnership can help to achieve this goal. © 2018 Society of General Internal Medicine","2018","2018-08-10 18:25:13","2018-08-10 18:25:13","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Article in Press","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1007/s11606-018-4547-y","<p>Article in Press</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ACA3EC5F\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study 1 included 3,853 researchers who published 3,161 articles in mathematics. Study 2 included 45,007 researchers who published 7,746 articles in genetics. Study 3 included 4,081 researchers who published 2,807 articles in applied psychology and 6,337 researchers who published 3,796 articles in mathematical psychology. Results showed that (a) the power law with exponential cutoff is the best-fitting distribution of research productivity across fields and gender groups and (b) there is a considerable gender productivity gap among stars in favor of men across fields. Specifically, the underrepresentation of women is more extreme as we consider more elite ranges of performance (i.e., top 10%, 5%, and 1% of performers). Conceptually, results suggest that individuals vary in research productivity predominantly because of the generative mechanism of incremental differentiation, which is the mechanism that produces power laws with exponential cutoffs. Also, results suggest that incremental differentiation occurs to a greater degree among men and certain forms of discrimination may disproportionately constrain women's output increments. Practically, results suggest that women may have to accumulate more scientific knowledge, resources, and social capital to achieve the same level of increase in total outputs as their male counterparts. Finally, we offer recommendations on interventions aimed at reducing constraints for incremental differentiation among women that could be useful for narrowing the gender productivity gap specifically among star performers. s © 2018 American Psychological Association.","2018","2018-08-10 18:25:21","2018-08-10 18:25:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Article in Press","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1037/apl0000331","<p>Article in Press</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\5ACVNJGD\display.html","","","STEM fields; Gender discrimination; Scientific productivity; Star performers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although well intentioned, targeting diversity initiatives specifically toward women instead of all employees may unwittingly make workplaces appear unwelcoming and biased to prospective employees. To test this notion, undergraduate women and men read a recruitment brochure for a company that framed its diversity initiatives as either targeting women employees or all employees. Both women and men felt less social fit and comfort with the company and were more concerned about being treated negatively and unfairly when diversity initiatives were framed as women-targeted rather than all-inclusive. These results held regardless of whether the company was portrayed as male-dominated or gender equitable (Study 1, N = 117). However, results were somewhat attenuated for women, but not men, when the women-targeted program was portrayed as initiated and led by women employees rather than upper management (Study 2, N = 152). Overall, our results suggest that diversity initiatives may more effectively convey identity safety to both women and men when framed in a way that includes all employees rather than targeting only women. © The Author(s) 2017.","2018","2018-08-10 18:25:41","2018-08-10 18:25:41","","745-766","","5","21","","","Identity-safe or threatening?","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\RBVVEWBD\display.html","","","gender; inclusion; affirmative action; diversity initiatives; recruitment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SZ4FQIFC","conferencePaper","2018","Burrell, D.N.; Nobles, C.","Recommendations to develop and hire more highly qualified women and minorities cybersecurity professionals","","","","","","The underrepresentation of women and minorities in computer science has been a concern to government, industry, and academia for more than 10 years. Researchers are indicating that within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domain, computer science is expected to experience the extensive growth through 2020 in the U.S.: yet, the pipeline struggles to produce enough college graduates to meet the demand. The shortage of computer scientists becomes more cumbersome when women and minorities remain significantly underrepresented, which means that women and people of color need more initiatives for inclusion in the equation. Organizations with Information Technology Departments have challenges with hiring cybersecurity professionals in this hypercompetitive environment due to a talent shortage. Considering the complexity of acquiring engineering and technical talent for organizations, highlights a deficiency in strategic initiatives aiming to hire more women and minority computer scientists and computer engineers. Diversity promotes differences in thinking and perspectives, enabling organizations to discover new vectors for problem solving, which have a dramatic impact on operational successes. Social scientists indicate that socially diverse groups and people with various specialties are more advantageous than a homogeneous group at solving complex, emergent problems. This is not only because people with different backgrounds provide different perspectives. Diversity can enhance the bread of knowledge and incite new practices by adding to an organization's intellectual capacity and innovative ideology. A diverse workforce is a core capability that provides organizations with a strategic advantage by approaching problems, projects, and strategies with holistic viewpoints such as minority computer scientists and engineers providing critical cultural and gender-based perspectives on engineering problems that are stymied due to shortsighted vantage points. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This study examines both aspirations for a master’s degree as the highest degree and aspirations for a doctoral degree as the highest degree for undergraduate engineering students. A theoretical framework in which educational aspirations are a function of social constraints and individual agency was used. Multilevel logistic regression models were estimated to investigate the empirical relationship between covariates and student degree aspirations. Results suggest key differences in degree aspirations at the intersection of race and gender, with minority groups exhibiting higher aspirations. However, these differences may be specific to males and master’s degree aspirations. In this study, White females are consistently lower than other groups on master’s degree aspirations, a result which extends the literature by providing an example of how a gender effect can be moderated by race/ethnicity. In addition, results indicate that the processes for formation of highest degree aspirations for the Master’s degree compared with PhD degree are likely different. The institutional variation in aspirations outcomes was relatively small when compared to the variation due to individual differences, implying that individual agency may play a much larger role than institutional constraints in aspirations formation. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2018-09-06 16:49:46","2018-10-26 16:29:28","","165-193","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\I2P8V9PA\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6YISXLYX\display.html","","Gender; Engineering education; Degree aspirations; Intersectionality; Race/ethnicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women and ethnic minority faculty in our study tend to be more proactive in building mentoring networks, and their networks generally consist of more diverse nodes compared to men and majority participants’ mentoring networks. Participants’ mentoring networks evolve as faculty move up academic ranks—assistant professors have extensive mentoring network with diverse mentor nodes; associate professors experience a shrinking of mentoring networks; and full professors assume the role of mentors in others’ mentoring networks. Findings suggest a multidimensional and evolutionary network approach has the potential to offer holistic understandings of mentoring and important theoretical and practical implications to women and minority engineering faculty development and inclusivity. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2018-09-06 16:49:59","2018-09-06 16:49:59","","121-145","","2","24","","","Mentoring women and minority faculty in engineering","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3S5H98BQ\display.html","","","Mentoring; Engineering faculty; Inclusivity; Multidimensional communication network; Network evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence shows that gender inequality is still pervasive in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Coastal geoscience and engineering (CGE) encompasses professionals working on coastal processes, integrating expertise across physics, geomorphology, engineering, planning and management. The article presents novel results of gender inequality and experiences of gender bias in CGE, and proposes practical steps to address it. It analyses the gender representation in 9 societies, 25 journals, and 10 conferences in CGE and establishes that women represent 30% of the international CGE community, yet there is under-representation in prestige roles such as journal editorial board members (15% women) and conference organisers (18% women). The data show that female underrepresentation is less prominent when the path to prestige roles is clearly outlined and candidates can self-nominate or volunteer instead of the traditional invitation-only pathway. By analysing the views of 314 survey respondents (34% male, 65% female, and 1% ‘‘other’’), we show that 81% perceive the lack of female role models as a key hurdle for gender equity, and a significantly larger proportion of females (47%) felt held back in their careers due to their gender in comparison with males (9%). The lack of women in prestige roles and senior positions contributes to 81% of survey respondents perceiving the lack of female role models in CGE as a key hurdle for gender equality. While it is clear that having more women as role models is important, this is not enough to effect change. Here seven practical steps towards achieving gender equity in CGE are presented: (1) Advocate for more women in prestige roles; (2) Promote high-achieving females; (3) Create awareness of gender bias; (4) Speak up; (5) Get better support for return to work; (6) Redefine success; and, (7) Encourage more women to enter the discipline at a young age. Some of these steps can be successfully implemented immediately (steps 1–4), while others need institutional engagement and represent major societal overhauls. In any case, these seven practical steps require actions that can start immediately.","2018-09-04","2018-09-18 13:30:19","2018-09-18 13:30:19","2018-09-18 13:30:19","103","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\A3TSUG6H\Vila-Concejo et al. - 2018 - Steps to improve gender diversity in coastal geosc.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\Q7J55CI7\s41599-018-0154-0.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study demonstrates how bibliometric visualisation can provide new insights into an area of literature by better communicating key findings, facilitating the exploration of data, and providing rich information to readers. Findings indicate that TCDM research has moved from broader topics to more specific issues, with a more recent focus on resilience and economic crises. The visualisation of co-authorship networks reveals that major collaborative networks are based on geographic and institutional proximity, dominated by scholars in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.

Eighty-one university students (65 women, Mage = 23.60 years) were given a fictional profile of an 8-year-old child with the task of teaching that child over Skype. Each child’s fictional profile was experimentally manipulated for gender (boy or girl) and gender stereotypicality (either gender typical or gender ambiguous). Results revealed that participants rated girls as less academically capable than boys in physics, and delivered less scientific information during a teaching module when they believed they were teaching a girl. Gender stereotypic girls were perceived as being the least likely to enjoy science. These findings are unique because they demonstrate clear educational disadvantages for girls because of their gender or stereotypicality.

To achieve these goals, the PINC program enrolls undergraduate students from non Computer Science (non-CS) fields, such as, Biology, that have become increasingly data-driven, and that traditionally attract diverse student population. PINC incorporates several well-established pedagogical practices, such as, cohort-based program structure, near-peer mentoring, and project-driven learning, to attract, retain, and successfully graduate a highly diverse and interdisciplinary student body. On successful completion of the program, students are awarded a minor in Computing Applications. Since its inception 18 months ago, 60 students have participated in this program. Of these 73% are women, and 51% are underrepresented minorities (URM). 74% of the participating students had nominal or no exposure to computer programming before PINC. Findings from student surveys show that majority of the PINC students now feel less intimidated about computer programming, and vividly see its utility and necessity. For several students, participation in the PINC program has already opened up career pathways (industry and academic summer internships) that were not available to them before. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","2018","2018-09-24 20:36:41","2018-09-24 20:36:41","","236-241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\7TC35XEG\display.html","","","Diversity; Gender gap; Cohort-based programming; Near-peer mentoring; Project-driven learning; X+CS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Barriers contributing to the shortage of women in academics and academic leadership are numerous, including a shortage of role models and mentors. Thus, achieving equity in a timelier manner will require more than encouraging women to pursue these fields of study or waiting long enough for those in the pipelines to be promoted. Social media provides new ways to connect and augments traditional forms of communication. These alternative avenues may allow women in academic medicine to obtain the support they are otherwise lacking. In this perspective, we reflect on the role of Twitter as a supplemental method for navigating the networks of academic medicine. The discussion includes the use of Twitter to obtain (1) access to role models, (2) peer-to-peer interactions, and continuous education, and (3) connections with those entering the pipeline—students, trainees, and mentees. This perspective also offers suggestions for developing a Twitter network.

However, interventions that highlight existing gender inequities may inadvertently act as a social identity threat cue for women. Including identity-safe cues in diversity interventions (i.e., suggesting that women are valued in STEM) may lessen these problematic outcomes. To explore this possibility, we conducted three experiments utilizing Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM (VIDS), a validated diversity intervention relying on high quality videos to convey the existence of gender bias in STEM. Consistent with prior research, relative to control conditions, VIDS led to greater bias literacy and lower gender bias among both men and women (Experiments 1 and 2) and encouraged women’s intentions to take collective action (Experiment 2). At the same time, compared to control conditions, VIDS resulted in lower sense of belonging in the sciences, greater negative affect, and greater self-reported social identity threat, both among women from the general U.S. population (Experiments 1 and 2) and female scientists (Experiment 3). Including identity-safe cues, which present a positive female scientist role model (Experiment 2) or suggest that gender bias can be overcome (Experiments 2 and 3), helped alleviate VIDS’ harmful effects on women’s belonging and trust in the sciences, but had limited impact on stereotype threat. These findings highlight the need for researchers and practitioners to examine potential unintended negative consequences of diversity interventions and investigate techniques to buffer such outcomes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2018","2018-09-24 20:34:06","2018-10-26 16:28:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Article in Press","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1007/s11199-018-0952-2","<p>Article in Press</p>; <p>Article in Press</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BCKAB8ML\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\VTWMQJMM\display.html","","STEM; Bias literacy intervention; Social identity threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Institutional Variation and the Gender Gap in Undergraduate STEM Degrees","","","","","","Studies of gender gaps in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) higher education have rarely considered 2-year colleges, despite the fact that most enrollees are women. Situated in an interdisciplinary literature on gender and inequality in students’ pathways to STEM higher education, this study used Beginning Postsecondary Students:2004/2009 nationally representative panel data on 5,210 undergraduate students. The primary research question posed was: How does initial college type influence the gender gap in STEM undergraduate degrees? First, we describe and illustrate distinct patterns in the degrees earned by men and women who initially enroll in 2-year and 4-year institutions. Leveraging rich control measures, we estimated a series of multivariate logistic regressions to robustly estimate gender gaps in non-STEM, social/behavioral sciences, life sciences, and natural/engineering sciences degree fields. Results from these degree clusters were distinct and underscored the limitations of “STEM” as an umbrella category. College type was more influential on the life sciences and social/behavioral sciences; effects on natural/engineering sciences degrees were experienced primarily by men, especially among baccalaureate degree earners. Gender gaps among life sciences and natural/engineering sciences bachelor’s degree earners were wider among initial 2-year students (favoring women and men, respectively).

Stereotypes may be gender-based (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses). In this study, I explored two primary research questions: First, would stereotyping STEM as a domain for nerdy geniuses negatively relate to women’s STEM identity? Second, would STEM identity mediate the relation between stereotypes and STEM motivation? Nerd-genius stereotypes and gender stereotypes negatively contributed to women’s STEM identity. STEM identity positively contributed to women’s STEM motivation (including expectancy-value beliefs). Participants were a diverse sample of undergraduate women (N = 195, mean age was 19.8; 30% of participants were Latina, 30% European, 24% Asian). Stereotype measures were (1) implicit gender-STEM associations, (2) explicit gender associations about STEM, and (3) a new scale that measured nerd-genius stereotypes. The results highlight the unique contribution different stereotypes make toward women’s identification with STEM and, in turn, their motivation to pursue STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2018.","2018","2018-09-24 20:29:47","2018-09-24 20:29:47","","","","","","","","“I’m Not a Science Nerd!”","","","","","","","","","Article in Press","Scopus","","Scopus","","DOI: 10.1177/0361684318793848","<p>Article in Press</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\9DH8IGT4\display.html","","","science; expectancy-value; implicit attitudes; sense of belonging; STEM confidence; STEM self-efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate how student anxiety is related to other academic emotions I conducted open-ended interviews with 19 university students and analyzed the data using emergent grounded theory. Emergent grounded theory uses inductive and deductive reasoning to develop a model of cognition and human behavior. Results: Data analysis led to the development of a detailed theoretical model outlining connections among student anxiety, positive and negative academic emotions, self-regulated learning, and performance. In addition, the data highlight important emotional differences between men and women that have the potential to influence retention in STEM. Specifically, the model elaborates on the concept of a self-deprecating cycle driven by negative academic emotions and suggests that women may be more likely to become trapped in this cycle. Conclusion: The model incorporates students’ emotions as a powerful influence on performance and can be used to inform strategies aimed at changing how university students experience and deal with emotions such as student anxiety. © 2018, The Author(s).","2018","2018-09-24 20:26:03","2018-09-24 20:26:03","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\XKE6CMZA\display.html","","","STEM; Gender; Emotion; Grounded theory; Self-regulated learning; Student anxiety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because it is restricted by the quality of polycrystal and powder specimens and the accuracy of characterization methods such as the conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), direct observation with atomic-scale resolution to reveal the structural details has not been realized, although electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies have indicated the complexity of the alpha-Cu2Se layered structure. Owing to developments in the focused ion beam (FIB) milling preparation method, high-quality single crystalline specimens with specific crystallographic orientations can be prepared to ensure that atomic-resolution images along a specific orientation can be acquired. Furthermore, the developments in aberration correction technology in TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) allow us to observe the subtle details of structural variation and evolution. Herein, we report, for the first time, the atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images acquired along the [(1) over bar(1) over bar2>](c) axis of alpha-Cu2Se using spherical-aberration (C-s)-corrected STEM from FIB-prepared single crystalline specimens. The observations revealed that the complex structure is generated by ordered fluctuations of Se atoms with various forms, including that some of the Se atoms on the two sides of the Cu deficiency layer get closer to each other than the others and the neighboring Cu deficiency layers have different forms of ordered Se fluctuations. These characteristics can only be observed along the [(1) over bar(1) over bar2](c) axis, while these details were not visible in a previous study along the <<(1)over bar>10>(c) axis or in our results obtained along the [(1) over bar 02](c) axis. By combining the electron diffraction patterns, several models of the unit cell variants were established, including the two-layer and four-layer cells (both have two different shapes) and the two-layer variants with and without central symmetry. These variants can also transform into each other, and an alpha-Cu2Se crystal can be formed through the random assembly of these variants. Using the program QSTEM, the corresponding HAADF images of these variants were simulated. The simulation results were similar to the experimental HAADF images and reflected most of the observed details, including the different forms of the ordered fluctuations of Se atoms and the dispersion of Cu atoms, which indicates that our structure models of alpha-Cu2Se are reasonable. This work provides new critical information for thoroughly understanding the structure of alpha-Cu2Se and the alpha-beta phase transition of Cu2Se.","2019","2018-09-27 16:08:30","2018-09-27 16:08:30","","139-144","","2","35","","Acta Phys.-Chim.

Transformation of the stem segments obtained from the mature material is an alternative to overcome or reduce the juvenile phase reported in perennial species such as citrus. However, some citrus species, including mandarins, are recalcitrant to these methods or have low genetic transformation efficiency. Thus, the alternative is the use of juvenile explants with high regenerative potential, such as cell suspensions obtained from citrus embryogenic callus or direct incorporation of DNA into protoplasts using polyethylene glycol (PEG). The present study aimed to compare these four genetic modification techniques for 'W Murcott', one of the main fresh market mandarin cultivars in the United States. The transgenic plants were obtained by the different techniques using a vector containing the EGFP gene under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. The genetic transformation efficiency was low, utilizing either juvenile epicotyl or mature stem segments, with an average of 1.23% and 0.33%, respectively. The genetic transformation efficiency using cell suspensions and cell suspension-derived protoplast explants were higher, with an average of 29% and 11%, respectively. Our results reveal the importance of utilizing cell suspension derived cultures for the efficient transformation of 'W Murcott'.","2018-12-19","2018-09-27 16:08:30","2018-09-27 16:08:30","","90-94","","","242","","Sci.

In particular, the catalytic performance of g-C3N4 can be easily modulated by modifying morphology, doping, and copolymerization. Simultaneous optimization, however, has little been achieved. Herein, a facile one-pot strategy is developed to synthesize porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets by using H3BO3 and urea as the precursor during thermal polymerization. The resultant B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets retain the original framework of bulk g-C3N4, while induce prominently enhanced visible light harvesting and narrowing band gap by 0.32 eV compared to pure g-C3N4. Moreover, the adsorption capacity and photodegradation kinetics of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation over B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets can be improved by 20.5 and 17 times, respectively. The synthesized porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets also exhibit higher activities than pure g-C3N4 as bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The enhanced catalyst performance of porous B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets stems from the strong synergistic effect originating from the larger exposed active sites generated by the exfoliation of g-C3N4 into nanosheets and the porous structure, as well as the better conductivity owing to B-doping. This work provides a simple, effective, and robust method for the synthesis of g-C3N4-based nanomaterial with superior properties to meet the needs of various applications.

Furthermore, pre-conditioning strategies with different agents could improve the efficacy of cell therapy. This study compares the effects of an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, melatonin, on protection of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, rat BMSCs and ADSCs were isolated and expanded. Pre-conditioning was performed with 5 pM melatonin for 24 hours. Cell proliferation and viability were detected by MTT assay. Expression of BAX, BCL2, melatonin receptors and osteocalcin genes were evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also, apoptosis was detected with tunnel assay. Osteogenic differentiation was analyzed using alizarin red staining. Results: No significant increase was found in cell viability between BMSCs and ADSCs after melatonin preconditioning. Following melatonin preconditioning, BAX expression was significantly down-regulated in both ADSCs and BMSCs (P<0.05), with the difference being more significant in ADSCs compared to BMSCs. BCL2 expression was increased significantly in both cell types after preconditioning. Metalothionine 1 and Metalothionine 2 were both upregulated significantly in the two cell types (P<0.05). Melatonin increased osteogenesis capability through increasing osteocalcin expression. However, expression of osteocalcin in BMSCs before and after preconditioning was higher than that in ADSCs. On the other hand, melatonin expression in ADSCs was in higher levels than in BMSCs. Melatonin also improved alizarin red concentration significantly in both BMSCs and ADSCs (P<0.05). Alizarin red staining severity increased significantly in ADSCs after preconditioning compared to BMSCs (P<0.05). Conclusion: Here we have shown that the effects of preconditioning on melatonin expression in ADSCs are higher than those in BMSCs. These findings could be used in adoption of a proper preconditioning protocol based on the sources of MSCs in specific clinical applications, especially in bone regeneration.","2018","2018-09-27 16:08:30","2018-09-27 16:08:30","","450-458","","4","20","","Cell J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000442109800001","","","","","in-vitro; Apoptosis; Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells; heart; liver fibrosis; Melatonin; Osteogenesis; pretreatment; rat model; survival; transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The establishment of defined, scalable differentiation methods is a step toward this goal. This study intends to investigate the competency of small molecule induced mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm (mESC-DE) cells towards ATII cells. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we designed a two-step differentiation protocol. mESC line Royan B20 (RB20) was induced to differentiate into DE (6 days) and then into ATII cells (9 days) by using an adherent culture method. To induce differentiation, we treated the mESCs for 6 days in serum-free differentiation (SFD) media and induced them with 200 nM small molecule inducer of definitive endoderm 2 (IDE2). For days 7-15 (9 days) of induction, we treated the resultant DE cells with new differentiation media comprised of 100 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (group F), 0.5 mu g/ml hydrocortisone (group H), and A549 conditioned medium (A549 CM) (group CM) in SFD media. Seven different combinations of factors were tested to assess the efficiencies of these factors to promote differentiation. The expressions of DE- and ATI I-specific markers were investigated during each differentiation step. Results: Although both F and H (alone and in combination) promoted differentiation through ATII-like cells, the highest percentage of surfactant protein C (SP-C) expressing cells (similar to 37%) were produced in DE-like cells treated by F+H+CM. Ultrastructural analyses also confirmed the presence of lamellar bodies (LB) in the ATII-like cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that hydrocortisone can be a promoting factor in alveolar fate differentiation of IDE2-induced mESC-DE cells. These cells have potential for drug screening and cell-replacement therapies.","2018","2018-09-27 16:08:30","2018-09-27 16:08:30","","469-476","","4","20","","Cell J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000442109800003","","","","","expression; in-vitro; a549 cells; Differentiation; efficient derivation; Embryonic Stem Cells; generation; glucocorticoids; ii cells; lineage; Lung; morphogenesis; progenitors; Regenerative Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vildagliptin (VG), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibitor, is an anti-diabetic drug, which increases beta cell mass. In the present study, the effects of VG on generation of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) is investigated. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ASCs were isolated and after characterization were exposed to differentiation media with or without VG. The presence of IPCs was confirmed by morphological analysis and gene expression (Pdx-1, Glut-2 and Insulin). Newport Green staining was used to determine insulin-positive cells. Insulin secretion under different concentrations of glucose was measured using radioimmunoassay method. Results: In the presence of VG the morphology of differentiated cells was similar to the pancreatic islet cells. Expression of Pdx-1, Glut-2 and Insulin genes in VG-treated cells was significantly higher than the cells exposed to induction media only. Insulin release from VG-treated ASCs showed a nearly 3.6 fold (P<0.05) increase when exposed to a high-glucose medium in comparison to untreated ASCs. The percentage of insulin-positive cells in the VG-treated cells was approximately 2.9-fold higher than the untreated ASCs. Conclusion: The present study has demonstrated that VG elevates differentiation of ASCs into IPCs. Improvement of this protocol may be used in cell therapy in diabetic patients.","2018","2018-09-27 16:08:30","2018-09-27 16:08:30","","477-482","","4","20","","Cell J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000442109800004","","","","","3-dimensional differentiation; Adipose Tissue; beta-cells; diabetic-rats; dipeptidyl peptidase-4; endoplasmic-reticulum stress; glucose; Insulin-Secreting Cells; iv inhibitor; mass; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin; preserves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non-scientific, reasons. Design/methodology/approach - The review covers research published from the early 1960s up to mid-2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior-reporting results in about 40 publications). Findings - The general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non-scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite. However, the results of the studies must also be deemed scarcely reliable: the studies vary widely in design, and their results can hardly be replicated. Many of the studies have methodological weaknesses. Furthermore, there is evidence that the different motivations of citers are ""not so different or 'randomly given' to such an extent that the phenomenon of citation would lose its role as a reliable measure of impact"".

"5PGKBQXU","conferencePaper","2018","Bossart, J.L.; Bharti, N.","Ten ways academic libraries can help their departments increase retention of women engineering students","","","","","","Since 2000, the percentage of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded to women in the United States has consistently remained around 20%. While more women may initially choose engineering as their major, too many do not earn an engineering degree. However, in graduation comparisons among different engineering departments, some programs, specifically agricultural, biological, biomedical, and environmental engineering, consistently show great success in the enrollment and retention of women. Research into women's preference for these engineering disciplines suggests that women earn larger proportions of undergraduate degrees in programs where they perceive their career will benefit society in the long term and that these preferred programs offer both the motivation to persevere in the curriculum and, once completed, greater prospects for a more rewarding career. Based on these findings, university engineering departments can help motivate women to major in engineering and to stay engaged throughout their college careers by offering opportunities to address societal challenges and reinforce the potential contribution they can make through their career. Academic libraries can provide valuable support to their universities' engineering departments in this important endeavor.

"CN63AINL","conferencePaper","2018","Mallette, J.C.; Ackler, H.","Valuing women's contributions: Team projects and collaborative writing","","","","","","Team projects offer opportunities for student engineers to learn how to work on a team and produce collaborative written reports. However, research has shown that women often do more writing during these projects, and that their writing labor is unrecognized or undervalued, particularly when the technical work is viewed as more essential. In this paper, we examine the results of a study focused on the writing component in a year-long senior capstone materials science and engineering (MSE) course sequence. This course requires students to complete projects for clients and produce a written report, among other deliverables. To focus more on writing education, the engineering professors brought in an English professor, who researches engineering communication and is coordinating this project, to consult on assignments, comment on student work, and present on writing topics, including managing the writing aspect of collaborative work. Here, we assess the impacts of interventions on student writing and collaboration, focusing on women's experiences through a series of interviews. These interviews focused on learning more about women's past experiences working on teams and the effects of the course interventions. Particular to women's experiences, we argue that by making the writing labor more visible in the project and insisting that each student contribute to the writing, women's contributions will not only be clearer but also more explicitly valued and their experiences will be more positive overall. After describing the findings, we offer recommendations to continue improving women's experiences in project-based classroom settings. These recommendations focus on ways engineering instructors who assign writing can ensure women's contributions are both visible and valued in evaluation. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:29:13","2018-10-09 20:29:13","","","","","2018-June","","","Valuing women's contributions","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KC83KTKR\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As means to encourage the retention of women in this class in the department of computer science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, two interventions were applied to address the issue of retention of women in CS. These interventions were based on the research findings where women are more inclined to solve real world problems that can benefit mankind and that women are dependent on social networking and more inclined to share their feelings with others when compared to men. The interventions were executed by offering a Facebook discussion group among consented students in the introductory courses in addition to replacing the traditional assignments with real-life problems in Fall 2015. The participants were surveyed to examine the effect of the two interventions. Our findings concluded that building the online discussion platform and using more practical problems can potentially help increase women's interest in studying computer science.

Engineering in particular saw only 20.9% of its bachelor degrees awarded to women in 2016 which is a slight 2.8% increase from 20071. This disparity creates a gender imbalance in the academic environment that persists into the work place. There are several factors that may contribute to the gender disparity in STEM, such as, but not restricted to, gender-stereotyping, lack of female role models, girl's image of engineering, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. In this paper, we address two of these factors: self-esteem, one's overall subjective emotional evaluation of their worth, and self-efficacy, a confidence in one's own ability to achieve intended results. This study used the State Self-Esteem Scale to examine two self-esteem factors, academic performance and social confidence, and the Engineering Self-Efficacy Test to examine the facets of general engineering skills and experimental skills. The study collected data from 38 female engineering students, of all academic levels, before and after attending non-technical conferences. Graduate and undergraduate students are rarely encouraged to attend non-technical conferences. However, these conferences present a non-threating environment in which students can meet female role models, develop leadership skills, and network.

This study explores the academic and career experiences of professional women physicists to propose different strategies to prepare, recruit, and retain women in the physics community. A qualitative phenomenological case study methodology was employed to analyze this problem through the lens of a sociocognitive theoretical framework, based upon psychological theories of behavior and derived from two career motivation constructs: 1) self-efficacy and self-concept, and 2) expectancy-value theory. Subjects included seven career women physicists with master’s degrees in physics and doctorates in physics-related fields. The influences of psychological and social variables were evaluated to generate theories on proposed strategies for inclusiveness. Various latent constructs related to career interest and retention were identified, including early interest in physics and mathematics, recognition of the societal value of physics, and positive experiences with role models. Tensions in their career pathways were related to pervasive feelings of inadequacy, lack of social support, negative stereotypes, awareness of minority status, and struggles with work-life balance. Suggestions for academic and professional institutional paradigm shifts are discussed, including active acknowledgment of disparate participation and increased efforts to recruit and retain women through improved school and workplace environments. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2018-10-09 20:18:39","2018-10-09 20:18:39","","95-119","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\DVVXSZ9D\display.html","","","Self-efficacy; Gender; Women in STEM; Expectancy-value theory; Phenomenology; Physics; Physics education research; Qualitative methods; Self-concept","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To combat this lack of gender diversity, colleges and universities have employed outreach programs and developed summer engagement opportunities that allow women to explore engineering before they graduate high school. As these programs grow, there is a need to explore how they are affect the women who participate in them. A research study was conducted to evaluate if two different week-long, residential engineering camps at the University of Dayton had a positive influence on participants' perception of and interest in engineering. One camp was a single-sex female camp and the other was a co-ed camp. Data was collected through observation and surveys. The surveys were used to collect quantitative data from consenting participants (n=l 12). The results of the survey indicated that the female-identified participants from the single-sex camp (n=54) were positively affected by their camp experience. The change from pre-camp to post-camp responses showed a significant positive increase of the average response in how participants viewed engineering (Ax=0.26, p=0.01), and their self-efficacy regarding becoming an engineer (Ax=0.22, p=0.04). In contrast, the results of female participants at the co-ed camp indicated that the average response regarding how they viewed engineering did not increase to the same degree (Ax=0.06), and their self-efficacy towards becoming an engineer decreased (Ax=-0.24). Though notable, this decrease showed no statistical significance due to the small sample size of female-identified participants at the co-ed camp (n=17). A comparison of the responses from female-identified and male-identified participants also supports existing research that demonstrates women having a weaker identification with math than men. These results suggest two things: a co-ed camp model may not be the ideal model for fostering women's interest in engineering, and a single-sex camp model can have positive effects on the women who attend and participate. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:16:21","2018-10-09 20:16:21","","","","","2018-June","","","The STEM gender gap","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\CBLVMJC5\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dataset includes over 5000 unique responses to the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS), an instrument that measures four types of motivation (intrinsic, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation) based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The SIMS was administered weekly to undergraduate students enrolled in a diverse range of undergraduate STEM courses across multiple institutions. Variable-based quantitative analysis reveals significant differences in motivations across traditional, mixed, and non-traditional course pedagogies. Students report the most internalized or autonomous motivations in non-traditional settings such as discussion- or project-based courses, and the most externalized or controlled motivations in traditional courses. Quantitative analysis also reveals significant gendered patterns in students' situational motivational responses. For the motivation subscale measures and self-determination index (SDI), the strongest gender-based differences appear in traditionally taught courses, with women reporting lower autonomous motivations and higher controlled motivations compared to men. The motivations of men and women are both more similar, and more positive overall, in STEM courses that employ non-traditional and mixed pedagogies. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:15:32","2018-10-09 20:15:32","","","","","2018-June","","","Gender, motivation, and pedagogy in the STEM classroom","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\43BCDWR5\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the goal of expansion and improvement of educational and professional STEM opportunities for women, this convergent parallel mixed methods study was conducted to explore the impacts of a formal peer mentoring program at Stony Brook University, a large research university in the Northeast U.S. Social cognitive constructs including self-efficacy, persistence, and engagement were measured by a survey adapted from Assessing Women and Men in Engineering for first year female students (TV = 51) in the Women in Science and Engineering Program (WISE). Most respondents (78%) reported that the initial decision to enter a science or engineering related field was because they were ""good at math or science,"" while 70% ""wanted to be able to get a well-paying job after graduation,"" and 54% ""liked to solve problems."" Most (72%) reported that the number one goal for entering the program was to ""help me do well in my major,"" with 58% reporting ""meeting other students my field"" as a secondary goal. Many respondents (43%) reported that the organization with which they most strongly identified was the WISE program, with 98% expressing confidence in completing their degree.

Qualitative findings showed that academic and social support were the two most common benefits from peer mentoring experienced by participants, indicating that the academic and social engagement provided by peer mentoring aspects of the program may be positive predictors of retention for first-year women in science and engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:15:18","2018-10-26 20:22:49","","","","","2018-June","","","The power of peer mentoring of undergraduate women in engineering","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\EF7SDXG2\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WEDFGHKV\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2MS9SPCH","conferencePaper","2018","Jordan-Bloch, S.; Cohen, S.","Engagement in practice: Infusing the STEM pipeline through community engaged learning","","","","","","This year, Stanford University's Clayman Institute for Gender Research launched a new initiative to address the glaring underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM-science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-fields. Motivated by the critical imperative of better understanding and addressing the gender biases that inhere early on in the STEM pipeline, this initiative aims to provide innovative training and support to young women in STEM as they transition through high school and college to successful technology careers. This initiative is distinct from traditional pipeline projects because it does not focus on the technical skills and education of STEM. Instead, the project takes an interdisciplinary approach to STEM education, infusing students' technical training with leadership training through a lens of gender inequality-bringing together key components of feminist pedagogy, community engaged learning, and experiential education to create a transformational learning experience. This is achieved by employing three core strategies: research-based education, a train-the-trainer model, and cohort-based learning. Our initiative launched this fall with approximately 100 participants: 17 undergraduate student leaders focusing on or interested in STEM, paired to co-lead 9 high school partner groups (each with 6-8 students). Our high school partnerships are with groups or organizations focused on STEM and vary in their context of socioeconomic advantage and learning setting (e.g., in-school and after-school). We are working in close partnership with Stanford's Community Engaged Learning program and the Haas Center for Public Service to build both an educational program and research agenda that emphasize the value of reciprocity, partnership, reflection, evaluation, and respect for diversity. In this paper, we present the lessons learned from our pilot year, including: the results from our feasibility evaluation, an assessment of our partnership model, and our approach to scaling. Assessment of the students and their progress is ongoing. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:15:04","2018-10-09 20:15:04","","","","","2018-June","","","Engagement in practice","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In engineering specifically, women only make up 13% of the workforce (up from 9% in 1990). Gender stereotypes persist today, even after decades of campaigns to change that. It is critical that girls are shown at an early age that women can be engineers and scientists. This will help them combat false stereotypes and remove obstacles between them and a career in these fields. To this end, we have developed a highly successful outreach program that focuses on showing elementary and middle school-aged girls how fun and exciting a career in STEM can be. Hands-on activities emphasize creativity and allow girls to explore STEM without being judged, worrying about what grade they might receive, or dealing with the potentially inhibitory or suppressive presence of boys. The activities are designed to leverage girls' existing interests by showing how STEM fields require creativity, can improve lives, or can make the world a better place. over one-thousand girls between the ages of 3 and 13 have participated in the last three years, and feedback demonstrates that the event has been successful at getting girls interested in engineering. This paper will detail how to plan and implement a successful event to interest young girls in engineering utilizing industry partners, student organizations, and fun girls-only activities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:14:45","2018-10-09 20:14:45","","","","","2018-June","","","Inspiring girls to pursue STEM (ages three to thirteen)","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KMBGM9KY\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This educational approach fosters students' technical and non-technical skills through group projects that require teams to apply their collective knowledge to solve various ""real world"" problems. Its collaborative, hands-on nature is appealing to instructors who are interested in better preparing their students for the increasingly complex and dynamic world of engineering. However, group settings have shown to put additional stresses on women in engineering, an already marginalized group in STEM fields. The results of this study, conducted at the University of Colorado Boulder, show that many women enjoy active learning because it helps them develop long-term material retention and problem-solving skills, as well as because they find it rewarding to see the effects of their engineering in action. However, women also reported that they face several challenges in team settings, especially being pressured to take on non-technical roles in group projects. In order for active learning group work to realize its full potential, the challenges that women face in team settings must be addressed in the classroom. If the issues are mitigated, active learning will become an increasingly successful way to prepare men and women for group work in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:14:36","2018-10-09 20:14:36","","","","","2018-June","","","Active learning group work","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MHRDZST9\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transitioning to a leadership mentality as a peer mentor has the potential to foster self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and socially stable academic relationships that may be replicated in postgraduate study and/or the workplace. This one-year study explored the experiences of junior and senior female students in STEM majors (N=11) serving as mentors to first-year students in the Women in Science and Engineering Honors Program (WISE) at Stony Brook University, a large research university in the Northeast U.S. The participants had also experienced mentoring by upperclassmen during their first year at the university. The conceptual framework incorporated factors related to self-efficacy and growth, communal agency, and leadership development. Qualitative data were collected through surveys and interviews with juniors and seniors. Many women expressed how rewarded they felt by their experiences with the first-year students, and they recognized the impacts of their work on the academic lives of their mentees. They viewed their mentees as more proficient in time management, work-life balance, and establishing effective social support structures. The mentors reported feeling confident in their leadership abilities and recognized the importance of supporting women as underrepresented participants in their university-based STEM community. They felt a personal responsibility to share their insights as academically and socially integrated upperclassmen. Findings suggest that mentoring programs should leverage the skills and achievements of peer mentors while enhancing their leadership transitions through the development of the self-determination of their mentees. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:14:27","2018-10-26 20:20:39","","","","","2018-June","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\764CH8TB\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\XN4KSKHF\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper will explore and assess the experiences of female undergrad students in STEM fields, including those who changed majors within the STEM fields or out of the STEM fields, using anonymous surveys with a focus on gaining insight into why some female students leave STEM fields (particularly engineering). Data will be analyzed for recurring themes among the students in their experiences both positive and negative (e.g., moments they thought they wanted to quit, experiences that caused them to feel they could or could not achieve a STEM degree, what changed their mind about staying, or what event caused them to switch to a different field). Though this research the authors' hope to gain insight into why some female students leave STEM fields and others stay. The goal of this paper is to correlate experiences of the female students with their subsequent actions on completing a STEM degree (or not). The hope is to pinpoint specific actions universities, colleges, and STEM based organizations can take to decrease the loss of female talent within the STEM fields. Additionally, this research hopes to illuminate experiences that encouraged females to remain in the STEM fields, add these actions to women mentoring programs at the university, and, thus, help future generations of women college students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","2018","2018-10-09 20:14:01","2018-10-09 20:14:01","","","","","2018-June","","","Women in STEM","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WXQR5KBF\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few studies have focused on gender concordance between mentors and mentees within the context of summer undergraduate research programs, and none have linked gender concordance with student gains. Previous research has more often overlooked the faculty–postgraduate–undergraduate triad, focusing instead on the faculty–undergrad dyad. This study explores the effects of gender concordance among mentoring dyads and triads on student gains from summer research experiences. Using programmatic and evaluation data, bivariate analyses were conducted and generalized estimating equations were employed to examine effects of gender concordance in mentoring relationships on student gains. Results indicate that gender concordance within undergraduate mentee and faculty mentor dyads promoted the greatest student gains among the six categories of mentoring relationships studied, having postgraduate mentors for undergraduates suppressed student gains, and women benefited more than men from gender concordance in mentoring relationships. Considering the results, undergraduate research program staff should make efforts to recruit more women faculty mentors, consider matching them with women undergraduates, train men scientists so they can be effective mentors for women students, and provide high-quality mentoring training opportunities for postgraduate mentors. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2018","2018-10-09 20:06:12","2018-10-09 20:06:12","","1029-1050","","5","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\M7V8UTRY\display.html","","","gender; mentoring; undergraduate research experiences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual differences in spatial ability have been found between males and females. In this study, a test of spatial cognition was administered to >3000 first-year engineering students over a five-year period. Students were divided into experimental and control groups based on a pass/fail cutoff score on the spatial test. Students who failed the test were all assigned to a 1-credit spatial skills intervention course that met for one session per week over a semester; those who passed the test were assigned to the control group. A regression discontinuity analysis was used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. A treatment effect was found for performance in a variety of introductory courses and STEM GPAs, with a particularly positive effect in Engineering Problem Solving and Analysis. These effects were found through a discontinuity at the cutoff score, with the intervention group performing at higher levels than would be expected if they had not participated in the intervention. Retention data was also examined, and it was found that the intervention had a positive impact on the retention of women in engineering. The results of this study suggest that spatial skills instruction can also be used as a key component for improving gender diversity in the STEM fields - beyond improving course performance. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","2018","2018-10-09 20:05:00","2018-10-09 20:05:00","","209-222","","","67","","","Does spatial skills instruction improve STEM outcomes?","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BQJ3WQ4D\display.html","","","STEM education; Sex differences; Spatial cognition; Student success","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted in-depth interviews with 26 women scientists in a top-tier academic research institution, a context that is steeped in negative stereotypes about women's ability and commitment as a reason for their underrepresentation. Stereotype threatening systems create the conditions for women scientists to experience heightened visibility due to their gender and heightened invisibility of the characteristics that make them successful scientists. We found that the strategies that women use to navigate in stereotype-threatening systems were patterned based on the goals that women had for managing their (in)visibility and that these goals were based on their understanding of the reasons for their underrepresentation in STEM fields.

However, no study has explored humor exclusively in the context of college science courses, which have the reputation of being difficult and boring. The majority of studies that explore humor have assumed that students perceive instructor humor to be funny, yet students likely perceive some instructor humor as unfunny or offensive. Further, evidence suggests that women perceive certain subjects to be more offensive than men, yet we do not know what impact this may have on the experience of women in the classroom. To address these gaps in the literature, we surveyed students across 25 different college science courses about their perceptions of instructor humor in college science classes, which yielded 1637 student responses. Open-coding methods were used to analyze student responses to a question about why students appreciate humor. Multinomial regression was used to identify whether there are gender differences in the extent to which funny, unfunny, and offensive humor influenced student attention to course content, instructor relatability, and student sense of belonging. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in what subjects students find funny and offensive when joked about by college science instructors. Nearly 99% of students reported that they appreciate instructor humor and reported that it positively changes the classroom atmosphere, improves student experiences during class, and enhances the student-instructor relationship. We found that funny humor tends to increase student attention to course content, instructor relatability, and student sense of belonging. Conversely, offensive humor tends to decrease instructor relatability and student sense of belonging. Lastly, we identified subjects that males were more likely to find funny and females were more likely to find offensive if a college science instructor were to joke about them.

However, there has been little empirical research on gender disparities in engineering which help underpin the effective preparation, co-ordination, and implementation of the science and technology (S&T) policies. This article aims to present a comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering publications across different specialties and provide a cross-gender analysis of research output and scientific impact of engineering researchers in academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web of Science database and 974,837 authorships are analyzed. The structures of co-authorship collaboration networks in different engineering disciplines are examined, highlighting the role of female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The findings reveal that men dominate 80% of all the scientific production in engineering. Women engineers publish their papers in journals with higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but their work receives lower recognition (fewer citations) from the scientific community. Engineers—regardless of their gender—contribute to the reproduction of the male-dominated scientific structures through forming and repeating their collaborations predominantly with men. The results of this study call for integration of data driven gender-related policies in existing S&T discourse.","2015-12-30","2018-09-28 14:51:25","2018-09-28 14:51:25","2018-09-28 14:51:25","e0145931","","12","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","","","","Engineering and technology; Mechanical engineering; Engineers; Industrial engineering; Citation analysis; Centrality; Civil engineering; Computer engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449–551, : The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, “subject” based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact.

Issues such as lack of female role models, gender stereotyping, and gender bias have been documented in agricultural education research. The purpose of this study was to explore the history of women's roles in vocational agriculture through the photographs of the Agricultural Education Magazine from 1929-1969. We utilized visual research methods to explore how women were represented in the photographs. We found 355 photographs with women in the pictures, 70 of those photographs met our criteria for visual analysis, and 17 photographs were included in the manuscript. The photographs showed women working in highly gendered roles as well as women breaking into typically male dominated roles. The photographs highlighted some of the first female vocational agriculture students and female student teachers. These women should be viewed as important pioneers in vocational agriculture.

Two measures are used to assess the reliability of rankings over time: Spearman's rho rank correlations among the citing journals and coefficients of variation among cited journals. Rank correlations of groups of journals can mask important changes in rank for individual titles, so characteristics of the journals with the greatest movements in rank over a decade are explored. Major findings are that the discipline's literature grew substantially over the decade, and the core journals remained stable over ten years (r  s  = 0.73). However, despite stability of core journals over time, some titles changed dramatically in rank. Coefficients of reliability calculated for this group of communication disorders journals suggests that approximately one-third of observed change in ranks is because of random variability in works cited.","2012-03-26","2018-10-25 16:25:01","2018-11-30 21:23:32","2018-10-25 16:25:01","80-93","","2","56","","","","","","","","","","en-US","Copyright (c) 2015 American Library Association","","","","journals.ala.org","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WYI3UJ6A\Black - 2012 - How Much Do Core Journals Change over a Decade.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\P7WDL3ML\5570.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are a multitude of issues that derive from the lack of diversification in the workforce: unequal representation, a lack of cultural-social understanding and insufficient relationship building. Exploring literature to determine the divergences and parallels between minority female experiences as faculty through qualitative and quantitative research identified their marginalization and underrepresentation in higher education. The literature examines that the experiences of women and people of color are at a disadvantage in faculty positions. It also suggests that women of color undergo further discriminatory treatment as faculty members and they are underrepresented. Recommendations are made for the restructure of institutional policies, the need for support groups and streamlining gender/race-inclusive curriculum.

For some countries, the issues begin with the right to education at even the earliest ages. In the United States, there is a prevailing assumption, because women are a majority of the undergraduate and graduate populations in higher education that a threshold concerning access and equity has been reached. The story of gender, however, is a more complex one. This article will focus on the parallel notions of significant progress in some domains for women in higher education and the paradox that depending on the level, and depending on which women, progress and in some cases lack of progress is clear. The article will review changes over the last decades and address the deeper issues of institutional transformation and the emerging issues for policy including conceptualizations of gender.","2017","2018-10-25 18:41:03","2018-10-25 18:41:03","2018-10-25 18:41:03","812-822","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ERIC","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6KTYKB27\eric.ed.gov.html","","","Higher Education; Females; Gender Differences; Access to Education; Civil Rights; Educational Change; Educational History; Educational Legislation; Equal Education; Federal Legislation; STEM Education; Talent Identification; Womens Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Units were surveyed regarding types of degrees offered, admissions policies, demographic characteristics of students, financial assistance provided to students, faculty ranks and salaries, and metrics by which the programs were evaluated by university administration. About 80% of the programs resided in 1862 Morrill Act land-grant institutions (LG) with the remainder housed in other non-land-grant institutions (NLG). Thirty-eight percent of reporting LG programs existed as stand-alone horticulture departments, whereas horticulture programs were combined with other disciplines in the remainder. Admissions criteria were most consistent among LG programs. Participation in distance education programs was low, but growing. Financial support of graduate students was more common in LG programs. Most schools offered some sort of tuition reduction to those students on assistantships/ fellowships and offered health insurance options. Payment of fees was rare and the level of stipends provided varied substantially among programs. International student enrollment was greatest at LG programs and had remained steady in recent years. Gender equity was present among graduate students, with nearly equal male and female enrollment. Most graduate students at both LG (63.6%) and NLG (75.0%) programs were non-Hispanic White; although overall minority enrollment had increased but was still not similar in distribution to that of the general U.S. population. Professors (46.7%) and Associate Professors (28.3%) dominated the faculty ranks while Assistant Professors (19.3%) and lecturers/ instructors (5.7%) constituted a much smaller portion of the faculty. Faculty salaries varied tremendously among institutions, especially for senior faculty. Female and ethnic minorities were underrepresented in faculty ranks compared with the general U.S. population. Aside from total graduate program enrollment, the relative importance of various evaluation metrics for programs was highly variable among institutions. Data discussed herein should be useful to universities with horticulture graduate programs for peer institution comparisons during program assessments, accreditation reviews, or for strategic planning purposes.","2014-04","2018-10-25 18:54:13","2018-10-25 18:54:13","","241-251","","2","24","","HortTechnology","A Survey of North American Horticulture Graduate Programs","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000337209000011","","","","","assessment; faculty compensation; faculty demographics; graduate   admissions; graduate student   demographics; graduate student compensation; graduate student training; iowa-state-university; peer institution comparisons; preparedness; salaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","Value-added animal agriculture: Inclusion of race and gender in the professional formula","Journal of Animal Science","","0021-8812","","","The Morrill Act establishing the land grant university system created public higher education institutions and paved the way for women and racial minorities to access them. Today women are similar to50% of the undergraduate population in animal science (AS) departments at the original land grant state universities, but racial minorities lag far behind, in part because the schools created under the 1890 legislation provided a diversion away from the state universities. Demographic trends from the U.S. Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate increasing positive growth in nonwhite workforce participation, with concurrent decreases in non-Hispanic male participation; men and women will be nearly equally represented by early in the 21st Century. In the faculties of AS departments, both women and minorities are seriously under-represented; causative factors underlying this phenomenon are similar. Although, historically, adherence to role stereotypes and divisions of labor explain some of the under-representation, these assumptions do not hold across all economic classes. Other factors contributing to the scarcity of women and faculty of color in AS include assumptions and mechanisms of scientific research itself; the very neutrality and disinterestedness of researchers, inherent in the scientific method, prevent recognition that values and personal biases affect decisions of hiring selections and mentoring effectiveness. We explore the cultural factors that underlie these values and biases that are common not only to agriculture but also to science more broadly.","2003-11","2018-10-25 20:11:19","2018-10-25 20:11:19","","2895-2903","","11","81","","J.

Data were also collected on the number of students participating in soil judging as well as tenure track and non-tenure track full time equivalent (FTE) soil science faculty positions. Environmental science, crop science/horticulture/agronomy, and other agricultural students enrolled in soil science courses in the greatest numbers. Environmental science and engineering students showed rapid increases in enrollment, while crop science/horticulture/agronomy and soil science student enrollment declined. Soil physics was the only class where declared soil science students were the single largest enrolled group. Soil judging numbers were consistent, while FTE faculty showed a slight decline. Students from many different academic majors took soil science courses at the universities investigated, and the most common majors in these courses depended on the course and the material it addressed. Overall student enrollment increased in all subject areas investigated except soil physics.

Design-Cross-sectional study. Sample-585 university students in South Dakota enrolled in 2 veterinary science courses over a 6-year period. Procedures-Each year, students enrolled in the 2 courses answered survey questions pertaining to their interest in becoming a veterinarian, background, and future plans. Results-Most students enrolled in these courses desired to become a veterinarian at some time in their lives. Females were more likely than males to indicate veterinary medicine as their current career choice. Most students developed their interest during grades 10 to 12. Females developed an interest in veterinary medicine earlier than did males. Enjoyment of animals, intellectual stimulation, and the opportunity to actively work outdoors were cited frequently as reasons for interest in veterinary medicine. Increased duration of education, high educational costs, and preveterinary coursework difficulty were major reasons for disinterest in becoming a veterinarian. Of students pursuing the profession, desired practice type correlated strongly with previous animal experience. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Considering that most students, especially males, developed their interest in veterinary medicine during grades 10 to 12, elementary school may be the best starting point for exposing students to veterinary medicine. To increase interest in large animal practice among students entering veterinary school, livestock experiences should be provided to children with no farm experience during their elementary, middle, and high school years. In our survey population, cost and duration of veterinary education had a significant negative influence on student interest in the profession.

I suggest that we need to educate a more diverse workforce and a workforce that adopts an international perspective on fisheries and wildlife conservation. Designing curricula to meet the professions’ needs will require on-going dialog with state, provincial, and federal agencies and will require innovative approaches that integrate knowledge requirements for these jobs with skill development.

However, medicine successfully recruits and retains women physicians, despite being less family friendly than biology in terms of workload, stress, and inflexible work hours. Both professions are competitive but at different times in a person's career. Competition for entry into medical school is intense, but this period of competition occurs prior to family formation for most women. For women biologists, the most intense period of competition occurs during the search for faculty positions. Many women have partners or children at this time. The increasing competition for academic positions threatens to reverse the gains that women have made into the professoriate in biology, as well as in other sciences.","2013-01-01","2018-10-26 18:31:12","2019-10-22 19:59:15","2018-10-26 18:31:12","43-48","","1","63","","BioScience","Attrition of women in the biological sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","bioone.org.leo.lib.unomaha.edu (Atypon)","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\2CDS5PCP\Adamo - 2013 - Attrition of Women in the Biological Sciences Wor.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\HXE738F5\bio.2013.63.1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such discussion is seldom quantitative. Here we present long-term student numbers (in undergraduate courses as well as MS and PhD graduates) of soil science departments in North America, Europe, and Oceania. A previous study by P. Baveye and co-workers had shown that in the United States and Canada student numbers fell by 40% in more than 80% of the universities between 1992 and 2004. The United States and Canada experienced an increase in female students in soil science between 1992 and 2004. Meanwhile, the number of foreign students has decreased. Student numbers have also decreased in New Zealand. Numbers at Dutch universities decreased in the early 1990s but have since stabilized. Two of three Australian universities had increasing numbers of students for undergraduate courses as well as MS and PhD graduates. Currently in the Netherlands almost half of all MS soil science graduates are female, while in the 1970s and up to the mid-1980s 80% or more of soil science graduates were male. It seems that teaching is becoming more general (more introductory courses to a range of other disciplines), while soil science research is experiencing an opposite trend: specialization.

Design-Survey. Sample-First-year veterinary students at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine during 2000 through 2003 and 2005 through 2009. Procedures-A 1-page survey was distributed to students during orientation exercises or on the first day of a first-year course on ethics and jurisprudence. Students were asked to indicate their expected salary at graduation and in 5-year increments after graduation and to indicate whether they expected to own a practice after graduation. Results-Responses were obtained from 567 female and 120 male students. There was no significant difference in initial salary expectations between male and female students. However, men had higher expectations for salary increases over the course of their career, so that expected salary was significantly higher for men than for women 5 years after graduation and beyond. A significantly greater percentage of men (69/93 [74.2%]) than women (242/499 [48.5%]) indicated they expected to own a practice. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Although male and female veterinary students had similar expectations with regard to initial salaries, the male students had higher long-term salary expectations and were more likely to indicate an expectation to become a practice owner. Differences in expectations may lead to differences in behavior when those expectations are or are not met.

The implications for teaching, learning, mentoring, leadership, professional development, student and faculty diversity, and curriculum structure are enormous. This article provides the groundwork for examining gender diversity in veterinary medical education. Women's development and ways of knowing are identified as paramount for understanding and benefiting students and faculty in their higher education experiences and in their professional lives. Seminal research focusing on women's development and ways of knowing is introduced, summarized, and contrasted to male-centered models, and implications for teaching practice are considered. Our underlying premise is that research about women's moral and intellectual development is relevant to veterinary education and supports the adoption of student-centered approaches to teaching and learning.","2009","2018-10-26 18:48:17","2018-10-26 18:48:17","","135-144","","1","36","","J.

The challenge of balancing life course events with career trajectory is an important determinant leading to premature dropout or slower career advancement. This report describes the findings of the first phase of a National Institute of Health Office of Research on Women’s Health (NIH ORWH)-funded study using survey and academic data for exploring satisfaction and awareness of/intent to use specific career flexibility options at the University of California, Davis (UCD). Methods: All men and women faculty in the UCD’s Schools of Medicine (SOM) and Veterinary Medicine (SVM) and College of Biological Science (CBS) were surveyed. Data also were obtained from deans’ offices on use of family-friendly benefits by faculty. Results: Three hundred twenty-five total survey responses were received from the SOM, 83 from SVM, and 64 from CBS, representing 42%, 46%, and 52% of their total faculty, respectively. In each school, large percentages of men (32%–60%) and women (46%–53%) faculty have children under 18 and a moderately high level of demand of family care responsibilities. Women were significantly more likely to be childless, particularly in the SOM (35% vs. 14%, p < 0.001). For all schools, documented use of any family-friendly policy was low (0%–11.5%), as was awareness of policies, although both were significantly higher for women than for men. Significantly more women than men wanted to use policies or chose not to, particularly in the SOM (51% vs. 28%, p < 0.001, and 37% vs. 23%, p = 0.016, respectively), because of multiple barriers. Faculty in all schools agreed/highly agreed that policies were important to recruitment, retention, and career advancement. Conclusions: Family-friendly policies are pertinent to men and women, as both demonstrate interest and need, linked to increased career satisfaction. A family-friendly policy is important, particularly for women in the biomedical sciences.

Using panel data from all American colleges of veterinary medicine (1976-1995), a fixed-effects model with lagged independent variables finds support for the concurrent effects of many hypothesized feminization mechanisms. Declining relative earnings and policies aimed at increasing production of graduates affect applications from men and women similarly, but feminization is driven by the decline in men's college graduation and their avoidance of fields dominated by women. The findings demonstrate the relative contributions and interdependence of supply and demand to occupational sex composition and the job search process more broadly.

Drawing on feminist epistemology and academic capitalism research, we develop and test four hypotheses about gender and UIRs. We use Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and data from a nationwide survey of land-grant agricultural and life scientists to examine perceptions of UIRs and individual-level ties to private industry among male and female faculty in different academic disciplines. Although we find no significant gender differences in perceptions of UIRs, our results indicate women have fewer ties to industry compared to men when controlling for individual-and discipline-level characteristics. In particular, industry funding of scientific research and consulting for private firms appear to disproportionately favor men over women. We also find that discipline-level industry ties influence scientists' attitudes and industry linkages, suggesting the existence of different disciplinary cultures with respect to UIRs. We recommend researchers, policymakers, and others interested in understanding the growth of academic capitalism, as well as the gender gap in science, pursue more in-depth investigation of the interaction between gender, academic discipline, and UIRs.

Although previously applied primarily to gender bias in athletic programs and participation, Title IX was created to address myriad aspects of gender equity in educational institutions and, as such, currently is being invoked in the realm of STEM academic employment. Accordingly, we analyze Title IX relative to categories of potential regulatory development in light of the policy environment and related dynamics.

We contend that a next-generation strategy is needed to translate multiple and complex theories to practice: We focus on the overlap of multiple social psychological theories to propose common-ground strategies to foster women's interest and participation in STEM. Building upon the foundational work of lone-theory approaches is a next-generation intervention approach that identifies where different theories have common ground—that is, where a particular intervention strategy might capitalize on multiple psychological mechanisms to yield benefit. We focus in particular on theories relevant to two incongruities that contribute to the gender gap in STEM: the incongruity between women and STEM (discussed in theories about stereotyping/discrimination, social identity, and stereotype threat), and the incongruity between STEM and student values (discussed in theories about expectancy-value, goal congruity, and work-family conflict). Three core strategies encompass multiple mechanisms described from these scientific frameworks, and these form the basis for intervention tactics: (1) Challenge stereotypes; (2) Align STEM activities with students’ values; (3) Cultivate growth mindsets related to STEM ability. We outline opportunities for structural change within educational and occupational settings that can enhance and sustain interest.","","2018-11-14 19:34:53","2018-11-14 19:35:02","2018-11-14 19:34:53","","","0","0","","","Finding Common Ground","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JLXYWTP4\Diekman et al. - Finding Common Ground Synthesizing Divergent Theo.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\EWTS3LJ5\sipr.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 160 men and women completed a math test that provided veridical positive and negative feedback, a memory test for feedback, and math self-enhancing and valuing measures in a stereotype threatening or neutral context while continuous electroencephalography activity and startle probe responses to positive and negative feedback was recorded. Indexing amygdala activity to feedback via startle responses and emotional memory network connectivity elicited during accurate recognition of positive and negative feedback via graph analyses, only stereotype threatened women encoded negative feedback better when they exhibited increased amygdala activity and emotional memory network connectivity in response to said feedback. Emotional memory biases, in turn, predicted decreases in women's self-enhancing, math valuing and performance.

Drawing on focus group discussions of women seeking employment in STEM, we find four identity positioning strategies through which the women assess future employers. Our analysis illustrates the role of organizational images for shaping and realizing individuals’ identity projects. We contribute to research on identity projects by extending the concept's focus to include job seekers as external organizational stakeholders and provide insight into their identity positioning. Furthermore, our study enhances the understanding of organizational image in the context of employee recruitment by outlining how individuals position themselves in relation to the organizational images they construct when reflecting on their identity projects and on the institutional context.

Here, we explore the role of racial phenotypic stereotypicality, or how typical one's physical appearance is of one's racial group, in STEM persistence. In a longitudinal study, URM students were especially likely to leave STEM to the extent that they looked more stereotypical of their group; Asian American students were especially likely to leave STEM to the extent that they looked less stereotypical. Three experiments documented a possible mechanism; participants (Studies 2-4), including college advisors (Study 3), attributed greater STEM ability to more-stereotypical Asian Americans and to less-stereotypical Black women (not men), than to same-race peers. Study 4 showed that prejudice concerns, activated in interactions with Black men (not women), account for this gender difference; more-stereotypical Black men (like women) were negatively evaluated when prejudice concerns were not salient.

These experiences of intersectional invisibility increase the likelihood of being scrutinized, isolated, and marginalized by the dominant group. Thus, exacerbating the chilly STEM climate. Using a nationwide sample of 176 participants, the current study examined microaggressions as an avenue through which women of color are rendered simultaneously invisible and hypervisible in STEM fields. Further, our study explored recommendations for addressing such experiences of microaggressions and intersectional invisibility. The four themes that emerged from participants' microaggressive experiences included: delegitimization of one's skills and expertise, implicit and explicit messages communicating their lack of belonging in STEM, instances where both their voice and physical presence were ignored, and gendered and racialized encounters. Nonetheless, students were encouraged to engage in agentic acts such as cultivating communities of support, internalizing messages of success, and foregrounding reasons for pursuing STEM.

While college programs have been found to represent the general population well in terms of diversity, the diversity drops off sharply after graduation, and our industry becomes largely homogenous in top-tier positions. Many initiatives are struggling to make a meaningful impact, especially when it comes to changing the face of our industry's above-the-line professionals. This is because, from entry-level through the development of top talent, the established system favors a narrow range of individuals who have fewer barriers to opportunity. However, this established system can easily be changed without major disruption. Having studied the efforts and impact of current programs, it is apparent that many tend to approach the issue backward, addressing barriers from top down instead of from the bottom up. Through case studies and the application of research and theory, we will present the analysis of current trends in diversity programs such as those offered by networks and studios for minority writers and directors combined with the available data collected from STEM fields. We will offer practical adjustments, considerations, and solutions to significantly improve the effectiveness of investments in diversity by companies and organizations across the film and television industry. Readers will have tangible, actionable takeaways that they can implement within their organization right away.

All Yale School of Medicine (YSM) graduating students submit a research thesis, and ∼5% are awarded highest honors. Gender disparities exist in areas related to physician research productivity, including academic rank, research funding, and publications. The authors asked whether gender disparities exist for medical student research. Method The authors conducted a retrospective review of 1,120 theses submitted by graduating medical students from 2003 to 2015 at YSM and collected data on gender, mentoring, research type, sponsoring department, and other characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression modeling examined gender differences in medical student research awards. Results Women authored 50.9% of theses, but earned only 30.9% of highest honors awards (OR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.74). Among factors associated with increased receipt of highest honors that differed by gender, men were more likely than women to work with a mentor with a history of three or more thesis honorees, take a fifth year of study, secure competitive research funding, undertake an MD-master of health science degree, and conduct laboratory research (all P <.001). After adjustment for these factors, and for underrepresented in medicine status and sponsoring department, women remained less likely to receive highest honors (OR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.98).

One factor that can contribute to the attrition is the lack of visible role models for women in academia. At early career stages, the behaviour of the local community may play a formative role in identifying ingroup role models, shaping women's impressions of whether or not they can be successful in academia. One common and formative setting to observe role models is the local departmental academic seminar, talk, or presentation. We thus quantified women's visibility through the question- asking behaviour of academics at seminars using observations and an online survey. From the survey responses of over 600 academics in 20 countries, we found that women reported asking fewer questions after seminars compared to men. This impression was supported by observational data from almost 250 seminars in 10 countries: women audience members asked absolutely and proportionally fewer questions than male audience members. When asked why they did not ask questions when they wanted to, women, more than men, endorsed internal factors (e.g., not working up the nerve). However, our observations suggest that structural factors might also play a role; when a man was the first to ask a question, or there were fewer questions, women asked proportionally fewer questions. Attempts to counteract the latter effect by manipulating the time for questions (in an effort to provoke more questions) in two departments were unsuccessful. We propose alternative recommendations for creating an environment that makes everyone feel more comfortable to ask questions, thus promoting equal visibility for women and members of other less visible groups. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

This article compares the percentages of articles with co-authors in alphabetical order (alphabetization) for two-author, three-author and four-author articles in eighteen social sciences in 1995 and 2010 to assess how widespread this practice is. There is some degree of alphabetization in all disciplines except one but the level varies substantially between disciplines. This level is increasing slightly over time, on average, but it has increased substantially in a few disciplines and decreased in others, showing that the practice of alphabetization is not fading away. A high correlation between alphabetical order and the proportion of first authors near the beginning of the alphabet confirms that high percentages of alphabetical order could affect the appropriate allocation of research credit. Similar patterns were found for science and the humanities. Finally, since some degree of alphabetization is almost universal in social science disciplines, this practice may be affecting careers throughout the social sciences and hence seems indefensible.","2013-07-01","2018-12-14 15:50:25","2018-12-14 15:50:25","2018-12-14 15:50:25","575-582","","3","7","","Journal of Informetrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\25N79MBW\Levitt and Thelwall - 2013 - Alphabetization and the skewing of first authorshi.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JKF68KDB\S1751157713000229.html","","","Collaboration; Research evaluation; Scientometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 1415 articles and reviews published between 1991 and 2012 were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. Standard bibliometric indicators and laws (e.g. Price’s, Lotka’s, and Bradford’s laws) were applied to these data. In addition, the Gender Inequality Index (GII) was obtained for each country in order to rank them. The results suggest an upward trend not only in the number of papers but also in the number of authors per paper. However, this increase in the number of authors was not accompanied by greater international collaboration. The interest in gender differences in science extends too many authors (n = 3064), countries (n = 67), and research areas (n = 86). Data showed a high dispersion of the literature and a small set of core journals focused on the topic.

One of the most cited gender differences in academia is the “productivity puzzle,” which suggests that women publish less than men, thereby affecting every aspect of a woman's academic career. Peer-reviewed articles published in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers (Annals) and The Professional Geographer (PG) between 1995 and 2006, and in four subdisciplinary journals between 2005 and 2009, as well as citation reports, were used to explore whether gender differences are present in publication productivity. Gender differences were evident in the proportion of women authors, the frequency of collaboration, and the number of citations across a broad range of prestigious geographic journals. For all journals studied, women were underrepresented, especially in the authorship positions that equate to notions of respect and merit. Although the number of collaborative articles increased during the study period, single-authored papers are the dominant mode of publication for both men and women for most geographic journals. The authorship patterns for frequently cited articles generally mirror those for all articles. Because the frequency of collaborative publication was high for women, the dual trends of a general increase in publication collaboration and increasing participation of women in academic geography bodes well for increased female productivity as it relates to publishing. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, currently, males as lead or single authors represent the predominant voice of geography within the journals examined in this study.","2012-11-01","2018-12-14 15:38:09","2018-12-14 15:38:09","2018-12-14 15:38:09","491-502","","4","64","","","Authorship, Collaboration, and Gender","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KL4DEZTJ\Rigg et al. - 2012 - Authorship, Collaboration, and Gender Fifteen Yea.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\2UZH2SZQ\00330124.2011.html","","","gender; authorship; autoría; citación; citation; colaboración; collaboration; género; publicación; publication; 作者; 出版; 合作; 引用; 性别","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Observational study. Study sample All original research articles published in Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine, The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) for one issue every alternate month from February 1994 to June 2014. Main exposures Time and journal of publication. Main outcome measures Prevalence of female first authorship and its adjusted association with time of publication and journal, assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model that accounted for number of authors, study type and specialty/topic, continent where the study was conducted, and the interactions between journal and time of publication, study type, and continent. Estimates from this model were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios against the mean across the six journals, with 95% confidence intervals and P values to describe the associations of interest. Results The gender of the first author was determined for 3758 of the 3860 articles considered; 1273 (34%) were women. After adjustment, female first authorship increased significantly from 27% in 1994 to 37% in 2014 (P<0.001). The NEJM seemed to follow a different pattern, with female first authorship decreasing; it also seemed to decline in recent years in The BMJ but started substantially higher (approximately 40%), and The BMJ had the highest total proportion of female first authors. Compared with the mean across all six journals, first authors were significantly less likely to be female in the NEJM (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.89) and significantly more likely to be female in The BMJ (1.30, 1.01 to 1.66) over the study period. Conclusions The representation of women among first authors of original research in high impact general medical journals was significantly higher in 2014 than 20 years ago, but it has plateaued in recent years and has declined in some journals. These results, along with the significant differences seen between journals, suggest that underrepresentation of research by women in high impact journals is still an important concern. The underlying causes need to be investigated to help to identify practices and strategies to increase women’s influence on and contributions to the evidence that will determine future healthcare policies and standards of clinical practice.","2016-03-02","2018-12-14 15:37:10","2018-12-14 15:37:17","2018-12-14 15:37:10","i847","","","352","","BMJ","Trends and comparison of female first authorship in high impact medical journals","","","","","","","en","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Methods A comprehensive search was conducted for all articles published in 1993, 2003, and 2013 in Radiology, the American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), European Radiology, and Investigative Radiology. The genders of the first and last authors were collected. Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis, and P values < .05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Results A total of 3,786 articles were reviewed. Overall, women constituted 20.0% authorship, 24.7% of first authors, and 15.2% of senior authors. The average overall female first and senior authorship grew from 19.7% to 32.1% and from 13.6% to 19.1%, respectively from 1993 to 2013. Female first authorship grew over the past 2 decades in the journals reviewed, with significant growth in AJR and Radiology (P < .0001). Female first authorship in the individual journals grew from 16.4%-29.1% in 1993, to 29.1%-34.8% in 2013. Female senior authorship also demonstrated growth in the past 2 decades, growing from 4.3%-17.5% in 1993 to 15.5%-23.2% in 2013. There was significant growth in senior female authorship in Radiology (from 12.1% to 19.2%, P = .004) and European Radiology (from 4.3% to 15.5%, P = .0433). Female senior authorship remained significantly lower than first authorship over the past 2 decades (P = .002, P < .001, and P < .0001). Conclusions Although women’s growth in first authorship in radiology literature is proportional to their growth in the specialty, they continue to remain a minority, especially in senior authorship, and demonstrate similar participation to other medical specialties.","2015-07-01","2018-12-14 15:36:51","2019-10-23 14:05:13","2018-12-14 15:36:51","735-741","","7","12","","Journal of the American College of Radiology","Assessing the Gap in Female Authorship in Radiology","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p>; <p>first author</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\A5I7X2U7\Liang et al. - 2015 - Assessing the Gap in Female Authorship in Radiolog.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\IN48QS9B\S1546144015001453.html","","","women; gender; education; Academic promotion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective To determine the representation of female physicians among authors of original research in U.S. gastroenterology journals. Design Retrospective. Subjects All first and senior U.S. authors of original research published in the years 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 in the following journals: Gastroenterology, Hepatology, American Journal of Gastroenterology, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (CGH), and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE). Main Outcome Measurements The percentage of female first and senior authors compared with the percentage of women practicing in academic gastroenterology. Results We evaluated 6490 articles, of which 2275 original research articles and 455 editorials were eligible for inclusion. Author gender was determined for 98.5% of the 3792 authors. Overall, female first authors increased from 9.1 ± 2.9% in 1992 to 29.3 ± 4.9% in 2012 (P < .0001), and female senior authors increased from 4.8 ± 2.3% in 1992 to 14.5 ± 3.6% in 2012 (P < .0001). Female first and senior authors increased significantly in all journals (P for trend < .05), except for CGH, and CGH and GIE, respectively. For each of the years examined with the exception of 1997, the proportion of women in the senior author position was less than expected based on the proportion of women among academic gastroenterologists (P < .004; P = .18 for 1997). Limitations Descriptive study. Conclusions The percentage of U.S. female physician authors of original research in major gastroenterology journals has increased over time, yet the percentage of women in the senior author position remains lower than expected.

It is also one of the reasons for the low representation of women and Black people in computing. Research has attempted to understand why these underrepresented groups feel like they do not belong in computing. These initiatives tend to analyze race and gender separately as if people experience these aspects of identity separately. For Black women who are seeking to belong in computing, these sorts of analyses are problematic. Black women are not just 'women plus color, or Black plus gender' [1]. Intersections of their race and gender yield unique experiences for them. Thus, analyses that only focus on women's experiences or Blacks' experiences leaves out the many nuances that result from one being both a woman and Black. This paper is an exploration of 'what it means to belong' in computing. By analyzing Black womens multiple identities through an intersectional lens, we show that most research for Black people or women is not inclusive of Black womens unique perspectives. We make visible a gap in computing education research that does not address intersectionality. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2018-12-14 19:09:44","2018-12-14 19:09:45","","","","","","","","Not Just Black and Not Just a Woman","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\VHFCN2CA\display.html","","","Black women; Intersectionality; Belonging; Broadening Participation; Computing; Identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology, RESPECT 2018 - Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions.

It is a theoretical and qualitative study of authorship. I explore the ways professional and student writers establish authority within models of authorship that disavow the body, particularly the female body. I analyze a range of texts: recent memoirs of twentieth-century women literary journalists (Mary McCarthy, Lillian Ross, Elizabeth Hardwick), scholarly memoirs of well-known feminists (Jane Tompkins, bell hooks. Lillian Faderman), editorial correspondence in the New Yorker archives, critical debates about academic personal criticism, the reception histories of literary biographies, and students' descriptions of their own writing practices. My project illustrates the limitations of a historically disembodied pedagogy and practice. Historically, professional women writers have had to assert a disembodied authority. Twentieth-century literary journalism, for example, stakes its authority on a masculine ethos positioned against a middle-class culture envisioned as feminine, consumerist, and domestic. Memoirs of journalists and academics illuminate the terms on which the female writer can be authoritative. More importantly, they serve as ""case studies"" in professional authorship, framing the kinds of ethos students can exercise in the composition classroom. Despite the growing number of student essays on anorexia, etc, we continue to think of the writing classroom as an disembodied space. Combining surveys with interviews, I collect the stories undergraduates tell about their own writing practices, tracing the ways these stories embrace and resist disembodied authorship. This preliminary study suggests that students in lower-level writing courses experience a dissociation between their own practice and professional models of authorship, models that demand particular effacements from them under the threat of accusations of illegitimacy. Ultimately, I argue that writing pedagogics that overlook the writing body may prevent students from identifying their writing as ""real"" writing. This study, and the revisionist history that informs it, points to new, more inclusive models of authorship, models in which the body, particularly the female body, can be both visible and authoritative.

The relatively high proportion of women attending 'coding boot camps' - 35%, as compared to 14% in CS university programs - would suggest that CS is of interest in the postsecondary female population. Yet little is known about the profile of women attending these camps and the type of expertise they are learning in the setting. This qualitative work attempts to address this gap by investigating the backgrounds of nine women in two boot camp settings. The research focuses on what they are learning in each environment and how these skills align with the routine to adaptive expertise continuum.

Despite recent progress, the gender gap appears likely to persist for generations, particularly in surgery, computer science, physics, and maths. The gap is especially large in authorship positions associated with seniority, and prestigious journals have fewer women authors. Additionally, we estimate that men are invited by journals to submit papers at approximately double the rate of women. Wealthy countries, notably Japan, Germany, and Switzerland, had fewer women authors than poorer ones.

Although there have been some strides toward more diverse representation, significant problems of underrepresentation remain in particular STEM fields: physical sciences, engineering, math, and computer sciences (PEMC). The purpose of this study is to understand the significance of pre-college personal and academic factors along with early college experiences to explain persistence among first-generation college students (FGCS) considering possible differences among PEMC-STEM majors, other-STEM majors, and non-STEM majors. Using institutional and survey data from one 4-year urban research institution in the Southeast, logistic regression models demonstrate the importance of early academic performance (first-semester GPA) to increase odds of FGCS persistence across majors; and also reveal important differences. Besides early academic performance, the only other significant factor for persistence of PEMC-STEM majors was perceived preparation in math. Perceived social fit was significant for persistence for the other-STEM and non-STEM majors, whereas perceived academic fit was only significant for non-STEM majors. These results align generally with previous research, and also suggest that examining differences among STEM subgroups may help develop more nuanced understandings of the needs of different groups. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, mediators that might account for this association are not well understood. In the current study, we propose that science self-efficacy may serve this mediational function. Specifically, data from a 2-year longitudinal study were used to test a model in which science self-efficacy was expected to mediate the association between research involvement and identity as a scientist. The ethnically diverse sample included 251 undergraduates who were recruited from colleges and universities across the United States. The hypothesized mediation model was tested with a cross-lagged panel analysis. As expected, greater levels of research experience at Time 1 predicted higher identity as a scientist at Time 3, and this association was mediated by science self-efficacy at Time 2. Exploratory analyses testing for ethnic and gender differences in the model suggested that the associations in the model were similar for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. From a theoretical standpoint, the current study provides novel insight into how research experience, efficacy, and identity relate to one another over time. Applied implications center on the importance of involving undergraduates in research that has the potential to bolster their science self-efficacy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article describes gender-stereotyped media images of STEM professionals and examines theories to identify variables that explain the potential influence of these images on STEM identity formation.

One exception is the gender bias habit-breaking intervention (Carnes et al., 2015), which, in a cluster-randomized trial involving all but two departmental clusters (N=92) in the 6 STEMM focused schools/colleges at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, led to increases in gender bias awareness and self-efficacy to promote gender equity in academic science departments and perceptions of a more positive departmental climate. Following this initial success, the present study compares, in a preregistered analysis, hiring rates of new female faculty pre- and post-manipulation. Whereas the proportion of women hired by control departments remained stable over time, the proportion of women hired by intervention departments increased by an estimated 18 percentage points (OR=2.23, dOR=0.34). Though the preregistered analysis did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (p<0.07), the study has a hard upper limit on statistical power, as the cluster-randomized trial has a maximum sample size of 92 departmental clusters. These findings, however, have undeniable practical significance for the advancement of women in science, and provide promising evidence that psychological interventions can facilitate gender equity and diversity.","2017-11-01","2019-01-08 17:19:26","2019-05-22 14:16:24","2019-01-08 17:19:26","211-215","","","73","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\HFXD6F35\S0022103117300860.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\8KK6CLR9\S0022103117300860.html","","Diversity; Gender; Gender disparities in STEMM; Hiring; Interventions; Prejudice reduction; Sexism; STEMM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also investigated STEM identity and gender disparities on academic achievement and flourishing in an undergraduate introductory physics course for STEM majors. One hundred sixty undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physics course were administered a baseline survey with self-report measures on course belonging, physics identification, flourishing, and demographics at the beginning of the course and a post-survey at the end of the academic term. Students also completed force concept inventories, and physics course grades were obtained from the registrar. Results: Women reported less course belonging and less physics identification than men. Physics identification and grades evidenced a longitudinal bidirectional relationship for all students (regardless of gender) such that when controlling for baseline physics knowledge: (a) students with higher physics identification were more likely to earn higher grades; and (b) students with higher grades evidenced more physics identification at the end of the term. Men scored higher on the force concept inventory than women; although no gender disparities emerged for course grades. For women, higher physics (versus lower) identification was associated with more positive changes in flourishing over the course of the term. High-identifying men showed the opposite pattern: negative change in flourishing was more strongly associated with high identifiers than low identifiers. Conclusions: Overall, this study underlines gender disparities in physics both in terms of belonging and physics knowledge. It suggests that strong STEM identity may be associated with academic performance and flourishing in undergraduate physics courses at the end of the term, particularly for women.

However, there are barriers to increasing the talent pool, including a persistent and pervasive pattern of implicit and explicit biases. These biases prevent opportunities for talented women and underrepresented minorities to contribute to STEM and contribute to workplace climates that are characterized by mistrust and low collegiality. Bias also reduces the likelihood of having diverse teams, which are higher in collective intelligence and are more innovative. Here we present the foundation of a new model that integrates the building of emotional and social competencies that drive team effectiveness. Our goal is to enhance such competencies in adults to foster better collaborative and creative capacities. We hypothesize that by building skills in emotional understanding and management, self-awareness, and social perspectives, team members will experience greater connectedness and collective intelligence. These skills in hand, the STEM climate will be more welcoming, and will have the foundation needed for inclusive excellence and innovative discovery. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","2018","2019-01-08 17:31:13","2019-01-08 17:31:13","","87-104","","","","","","From bias to BEST teams","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\DISWS8ZN\display.html","","","STEM; Emotional intelligence; Innovation; Social competencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Findings illustrated that undergraduates who reported receiving more instrumental and socioemotional mentoring were higher in scientist identity. Further, mentors who reported engaging in higher levels of negative mentoring had undergraduates with lower scientist identity.

To seek more detailed insights across all subjects, this article compares practising US male and female researchers between and within 285 narrow Scopus fields inside 26 broad fields from their first-authored articles published in 2017. The comparison is based on publishing fields and the words used in article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The results cannot be fully explained by the people/thing dimensions. Exceptions include greater female interest in veterinary science and cell biology and greater male interest in abstraction, patients, and power/control fields, such as politics and law. These may be due to other factors, such as the ability of a career to provide status or social impact or the availability of alternative careers. As a possible side effect of the partial people/thing relationship, females are more likely to use exploratory and qualitative methods and males are more likely to use quantitative methods. The results suggest that the necessary steps of eliminating explicit and implicit gender bias in academia are insufficient and might be complemented by measures to make fields more attractive to minority genders.","2019-02-01","2019-01-08 17:36:11","2019-01-08 17:36:11","2019-01-08 17:36:11","149-169","","1","13","","Journal of Informetrics","Gender differences in research areas, methods and topics","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\PBL24NLC\S1751157718303596.html","","","STEM; Academia; Gender; Disciplines; Underrepresentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of science identity has become a point of interest in this process; it has been suggested that development of one's identity as a scientist is critical to persistence in the field. Metaphors that are rooted in bodily experience can provide a starting point to understand abstract concepts, including science identity and how we as STEM educators respond to increasing diversity within our fields. Given the history of STEM being predominantly populated by people who are white and male, disorientation or discomfort with increasing diversity is not unexpected, and many women and people of color report discrimination and marginalization as a part of their experience in STEM. Here I present a neuroscience-based metaphor that can serve as a starting point for understanding some of the potential disorientation or discomfort that we may experience as we engage with the increasing diversity of STEM and acknowledge this experience as a normal but temporary part of the process of growth and development as a field. I encourage the development and use of further discipline-based metaphors to enhance our discussion and understanding of this important work.","2019","2019-01-08 19:20:07","2019-01-08 19:20:07","","1-6","","1","43","","","Motion sickness as metaphor","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\U6YR9A9U\display.html","","","inclusion; identity; conceptual metaphor; neuroscience; race; science identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where individuals reside in the hierarchy of membership is determined by not only what they talk and write about, but how. Yet, there are many factors that can impact newcomers’ acculturation into a disciplinary community on a rhetorical level. In this article, I use positioning theory and intersectional identity to examine how Anne, a woman of color participating in undergraduate research in science, learned to read and write as a scientist and the ways her social position as a woman, person of color, and low-income and first-generation student influenced her perception and adoption of the discourse as her own. I argue that social positioning influences students’ views of scientific discourse and affects their rhetorical skill development as scientific writers. Because recognition as a group insider is heavily influenced by discourse, this research has potential implications for those interested in retention and persistence of women of color in STEM, as well as for those interested in changing learning cultures and incorporating writing instruction into disciplinary arenas. © 2018 SAGE Publications.","2019","2019-01-08 19:20:33","2019-01-08 19:20:33","","9-37","","1","36","","","“I Think When I Speak, I Don’t Sound Like That”","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3FAAPZPZ\display.html","","","intersectionality; underrepresented minorities; identity as position; longitudinal case study; sociocultural issues; writing in STEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted focus groups with a total of 67 students. We recruited students from women in engineering programs (n = 29), minority engineering programs (n = 14), and diversity in engineering programs (n = 24). We identified 7 themes that represent 11 perceived advantages and 4 perceived disadvantages, and noted differences across student support centers. Findings from this study will assist engineering colleges with offering suites of student interventions that positively influence the undergraduate experience while mitigating unintended negative impacts. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2019-01-08 19:24:39","2019-07-23 18:39:27","","195-226","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\W8BL4QWN\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\P2R93LGH\00551c876cc2f027,1c5a21585279c945,6b6b1ce26c93d4c5.html","","","Diversity; Inclusion; Student success; Co-curricular; Targeted support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often, women at the intersection of race/ethnicity, gender, college generational status are systematically overlooked in engineering education research but face compounding discrimination and barriers towards success. We used a qualitative thematic analysis approach to explore how Latinas who are first-generation college students described their engineering experience, engineering culture, and feelings of belongingness and how this, in turn, informed their academic self-efficacy, institutional integration, and achievement within engineering. We used the Collegiate Achievement Model to understand the extent to which students at the intersection of multiple social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, first-generation college student status) developed academic and social integration into engineering and how that impacted their persistence. We found that while our participants held a high sense of academic self-efficacy, their main challenge was feeling a sense of belonging, which is predicated on having ingroup support. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of support within engineering programs and the impact of multiple intersecting identities on individual’s experiences. This work also gives voice to a population that is often silenced by small numbers and critically examines how these students do or do not feel that they belong in engineering. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.","2018","2019-01-08 19:25:59","2019-01-08 19:26:09","","261-290","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\RKIQZPWD\display.html","","","Engineering; Intersectionality; Latinas; Collegiate achievement model; First-generation college students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated whether women’s experiences of sexual harassment and STEM-related gender bias negatively predicted their STEM motivation (task value, competence beliefs, and perceived costs) and STEM career aspirations. We also tested whether STEM encouragement from friends and family positively predicted motivation and aspirations. To consider domain-specific effects, we also tested the predictors in relation to non-STEM motivation and career aspirations. Students’ grade point average was controlled in all analyses. The sample was undergraduate women enrolled in gateway biology courses for majors (N = 685; M = 19.67 years of age; 35% Asian, 31% White, and 27% Latinx). A majority experienced gender bias (60.9%) or sexual harassment (78.1%) at least once in the past year. STEM-related gender bias from classmates and sexual harassment from instructors (faculty, teaching assistants, or graduate students) were negatively related to STEM motivation and career aspirations. Perceived STEM encouragement from friends was positively related to motivation, and STEM encouragement from friends and family predicted STEM career aspirations. Finally, domain-specific effects were indicated. Our research highlights the need for programs that increase awareness of discrimination, combat bias and harassment, and affirm students’ STEM interest.

Focus group interviews with Latino high school students confirmed the three cost dimensions, but there were some cultural sources of cost unique to our sample. Consequently, we modified and refined existing cost items to create a STEM-specific and culturally contextualized cost scale. We utilized our scale to examine how high school students at the intersection of gender, ethnicity, and math identification differ in cost perceptions.

Many of the fundamental concepts and definitions associated with cyberbullying are still being developed. The problem addressed was the difficulty school counselors have in ascertaining the extent of cyberbullying, in identifying incidents of cyberbullying, and in the lack of research-based intervention and prevention resources. A qualitative research method using a single case study design was used because it aligned well with an examination of perceptions, views, and ideas of school counselors as educational leaders. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to investigate from a school counselor perspective what cyberbullying events were actually happening, what was being done in response, what more needed to be done, and what opportunities existed to close the gap between what was actually being done and what should be done. A purposeful sample of 39 secondary school counselors participated in focus groups and semi-structured interviews in which they answered questions regarding their experience with cyberbullying in their schools. Data analysis included the coding of the qualitative data through a case study method into common typologies using analytical techniques to include explanation building and pattern matching. The goal was to gain insight on cyberbullying utilizing school counselors in their role as educational leaders to aid the school in setting school policies when dealing with cyberbullying. Results indicated secondary school counselors were aware of some cyberbullying incidents, the prevalence of cyberbullying was an ongoing issue, and when addressing cyberbullying, school counselors utilized their professional training and leadership skills to positively impact school climate in cyberbullying prevention and intervention. Recommendations include school counselors as leaders in nation-wide curriculum development for cyberbullying prevention and intervention, on advisory teams to investigate, prevent, and intervene in cyberbullying within their schools, in implementing cyberbullying prevention programs in schools, and in training parents and other professionals on the nature and prevalence of cyberbullying. Future research could include how to identify and assist students who may be at an increased risk of cyberbullying, how to develop school-wide programs to combat cyberbullying, how to utilize stakeholders in establishing prevention and intervention plans, or how to utilize expert input for the school and district on cyberbullying issues.","2014","2019-01-24 20:40:58","2019-01-24 20:41:13","2019-01-24 20:40:58","","197","","","","","","","","","","Northcentral University","United States -- Arizona","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ZUNJBCL9\King - 2014 - A Case Study of the Perceptions of Secondary Schoo.pdf","","","Education; Bullying; Counselor; Cyberbullying; Educational leadership; School counseling; Secondary schools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One negative form of interaction that has emerged is cyberbullying, where youth bully each other through digital and online tools. While several studies have examined students' and preservice teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying, there is a critical gap in the research literature about inservice teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying. Thus, the aim of this exploratory research study was to investigate middle school teachers' knowledge of cyberbullying, their experiences managing cyberbullying, their concerns about and confidence to address cyberbullying, and their perceptions of their role in preventing and responding to cyberbullying. The study was conducted at a public middle school (6th–8th grade site) within a suburban school district in the Western region of the United States. A qualitative case study approach was employed. In-depth interviews were conducted with six middle school teachers and three school leaders at the middle school using semi-structured interview protocols. The data from the interviews was read and coded to identify the predominant themes. In addition, seven school/district policy documents were analyzed for their inclusion of cyberbullying-specific policies and procedures. The data from the teacher interviews, school leader interviews, and document analysis resulted in five key findings. First, teachers lack knowledge of the prevalence of cyberbullying on campus. Second, teachers lack knowledge of the school's procedure for handling cyberbullying. Third, teachers have had varied experiences managing cyberbullying. Fourth, teachers are more confident that they can identify cyberbullying than manage it. Lastly, teachers perceive themselves as having a definite role in preventing and responding to cyberbullying. Based on these findings, the following five recommendations for practice were made: conducting a school-wide cyberbullying assessment, providing cyberbullying professional development/training to teachers, developing a comprehensive cyberbullying procedure, including cyberbullying-specific policies in the school/district policy documents, and providing ongoing education about cyberbullying. Future research should be conducted about the impact of cyberbullying training/professional development on teachers' confidence to address cyberbullying and teacher practices as they pertain to educating students about cyberbullying. In addition, a comparative study should be conducted to examine the knowledge, perceptions, and experiences of teachers, students, school leaders, and parents in relation to one another.","2012","2019-01-24 20:40:58","2019-01-24 20:41:12","2019-01-24 20:40:51","","202","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern California","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ed.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\4ESYIL2S\Noah - 2012 - Middle school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullyi.pdf","","","Education; Bullying; Cyberbullying; Middle school; Perceptions; Teachers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there remained many limitations in previous studies that were not addressed. The current study extended this line of research to a non-Western context, Malaysia, and focused on cyberbullying on Facebook, the most popular social media platform among adolescents around the world. Specifically, this investigation addressed three research questions: (1.) whether experiences of cyberbullying on Facebook were common among Malaysian adolescents; (2.) how cyberbullying on Facebook was associated with psychosocial adjustment, and (3.) how the relation between cyberbullying on Facebook and psychosocial adjustment varied in accordance with factors such as characterological self-blame among victims of cyberbullying, anonymity of cyberbully, and friend support for victims of cyberbullying. Participants were 119 high school students recruited from two public high schools in Penang, and Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, who completed measures of cyberbullying and psychosocial adjustment over a period of three months, including pre-, weekly, and post-assessment. Evidence of cyberbullying happening amongst Malaysian adolescents were found in the current study. Demographic variables such as socio economic status, and gender, along with pre-measures of cyberbullying, and psychosocial adjustment were controlled before proceeding with the analyses for the remaining hypothesis. Results did not support the hypothesis that cyberbullying was prevalent in Malaysia. Correlations showed frequent usage of Facebook which was negatively related to cyberbullying. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the distinction between private and public forms of cyberbullying on Facebook. Results of regression analyses demonstrated that public and private forms of cyberbullying on Facebook were distinctly related to psychosocial adjustment. Public forms of cyberbullying on Facebook was positively associated with depression and negatively related to social anxiety whereas private forms of cyberbullying was associated with an increase in social anxiety. Results did not support the hypotheses for characterological self-blame and friendship quality as moderators but provided evidence for the moderating role of anonymity of cyberbullies. Specifically, the interactions between public forms of cyberbullying and anonymity of cyberbullies were found for depression, social anxiety, and self-esteem, but the direction of interaction was opposite to what was predicted for self-esteem. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that cyberbullying on Facebook happens amongst Malaysian adolescents with relatively low frequency but in both public and private forms. Furthermore, public and private forms of cyberbullying on Facebook seem to have distinct effects on psychosocial adjustment for Malaysian adolescents and some of these effects appear to vary depending on whether the victim knows the identity of cyberbullies.

Potential predictors of class membership were also examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Participants were 849 German students (52.7% girls, 45.6% boys, Mage = 13.4 years, SDage = 1.1 years). Observed indicators of latent class measured own involvement in cyberbullying, reactions to cyberbullying of classmates, and behavioral willingness as assistant and as defender. Indicators for the post-hoc regression analyses were proactive aggression, reactive aggression, self-esteem, cognitive, and affective empathy. Control variables were age and gender. A model with five classes was chosen. The classes were labeled prosocial defenders, communicating outsiders, aggressive defenders, bully-victims, and assistants. The results of the post-hoc regression analyses showed that students in the classes especially differed regarding types of aggression and social competencies. Based on answer patterns, cyberbullying roles beyond the bullying-triad can be found. Remarkably, three of the classes are bystanders, i.e. they are not directly involved in cyberbullying. Two of these classes showed helping behavior and made up almost two thirds of the sample. Knowledge about cyberbullying roles and their predictors is important to inform the planning and development of interventions. The results further indicate that interventions should especially take into account antisocial and passive behavioral patterns in the context of cyberbullying.","2018-12","2019-01-24 20:25:36","2019-01-24 20:25:36","2019-01-24 20:25:36","1-21","","4","12","","Cyberpsychology","Who is involved in cyberbullying?","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>What do you think of this one? </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\PN7NZGBJ\Schultze-Krumbholz et al. - 2018 - Who is involved in cyberbullying Latent class ana.pdf","","","Cyberbullying; CYBERBULLYING; empathy; aggression; AGGRESSION (Psychology); bystanders; cyberbullying roles; EMPATHY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, perceiving and interpreting an incident as an emergency situation, realizing one's own responsibility to intervene, and forming the intention to help are crucial preconditions for bystander interventions. The characteristics of information and communication technologies (ICTs) change and hamper these cognitive processes. Information and cues that guide individuals' reactions to offline victimization are missing in many online environments (e.g., seeing a victim's suffering). By applying a scenario-based experiment (n = 240; 62% female; Mage = 21.3), we investigate how cyberbullying incidents with differing degrees of severity (insults only vs. insults and threats) affect bystanders' perception of the incident, their tendency to blame the victim, and finally their reactions to cyber victimization (i.e., willingness to help). Our results showed that participants evaluated an incident that included threats and insults (as compared to insults only) as more severe; this in turn was related to a higher willingness to help the victim. In contrast, a seemingly less severe incident (containing insults only) fostered participants' tendency to ascribe (at least partial) blame for the incident to the victim. This victim blaming correlated with a lower tendency to support the victim. In conclusion, victims of seemingly less serious incidents in particular are at risk of experiencing prolonged suffering because bystanders fail to identify the emergency character of the situation and refuse to help.","2018-12","2019-01-24 20:23:39","2019-01-24 20:23:39","2019-01-24 20:23:37","1-15","","4","12","","Cyberpsychology","""Do I really need to help?","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\56CBV782\Koehler and Weber - 2018 - Do I really need to help!

This study analyses teachers' and students' perception of the problem, as well as the strategies that both groups use to avoid it. Its findings will allow advances in prevention and intervention in the schools. The study was conducted on 1,704 primary and secondary school students and 238 teachers who completed questionnaires about cyberbullying. We used a cross-sectional descriptive method. Findings show significant differences in the motives teachers attributed to cyberbullying. These depend on the educational stage they work in, whereas, among students, it depends on the role they have in the cyberbullying situation: victim or aggressor. We also find differences in the intervention strategies used by teachers, depending on the type of school, educational stage, and gender. Those used the most are communicating, mediating and seeking help. For students, the predominant strategies are avoidance, protection, and reporting. Schoolchildren, in general, show little confidence in their teachers' ability to solve the problem of cyberbullying. The study highlights the importance of training teachers and providing them with action models when faced with this issue, and it points out the necessity of coordinating the efforts of both teachers and students.

Despite the growth of research on cyberbullying in schools and the development of practice in schools to deal with cyberbullying, our understanding of this phenomenon still needs to address more clearly the complexities involved. Design: Student teachers are largely in their early 20s and are of an age to have been through the school system as pupils at a time when cyberbullying was becoming common and widespread, and will themselves soon be dealing with cyberbullying in schools as newly appointed teachers. The design of this study comprised a questionnaire survey of the views held by student teachers to inform our understanding of cyberbullying in schools and how best to deal with it. Methods: The questionnaire explored the views of 97 student teachers regarding the motives that underpin cyberbullying and the strategies that could help reduce cyberbullying, together with a final open-ended question seeking the student teachers' wider views. Results: A quantitative analysis of their responses to the 20 rating-scale items and a qualitative analysis of their responses to the open-ended question, indicated that these student teachers viewed the main motive for cyberbullying as the cyberbully enjoying the exercise of power, and that the most effective strategy to reduce cyberbullying was to include cyberbullying in lessons on e-safety. Conclusions: The views held by student teachers on cyberbullying reported here have important implications for school practice, teacher education and the professional development needs of newly appointed teachers.","2018-09","2019-01-24 20:23:39","2019-07-23 18:40:15","2019-01-24 20:23:38","23-27","","2","42","","Psychology of Education Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\TRCK4M6P\Kyriacou and Issitt - 2018 - Student teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying in .pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\FXCNCJLN\Kyriacou and Issitt - 2018 - Student teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying in .pdf","","","CYBERBULLYING; INTERNET -- Safety measures; QUESTIONNAIRES; STUDENT teachers; TEACHER development; TEACHER education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explain this first finding by the differential effect of perceived union power, which is greater in Canada than the US and which is correlated negatively with union approval. We also find that US managers are less likely to use extreme methods to oppose union organizing drives, implying that the lower union rates in the US as compared to Canada are not likely the result of greater negativity towards unions themselves but rather some other factor or combination of factors. The implication is that if Canadian managers faced the same labor relations playing field as their US counterparts, they would likely find it easier to thwart union certification drives as well. Alternatively stated, Canadian-style labor relations reforms (such as card-check systems or quicker certification votes) could perhaps tip the balance in favor of unions when organizing in the US.","2013-03","2019-01-28 20:55:05","2019-01-28 20:55:29","2019-01-28 20:55:03","99-119","","1","34","","Journal of Labor Research","Managerial Hostility and Attitudes Towards Unions","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\GBLBKKGG\Campolieti et al. - 2013 - Managerial Hostility and Attitudes Towards Unions.pdf","","","United States; Labor unions; Attitudes; Canada; Canada-US differences; Executives' attitudes; J51; J52; Labor organizing; Labor unions -- Canada; Labor unions -- Political activity; Labor unions -- United States; Managerial opposition; PUBLIC relations; Unions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that because freedom of association is a hypernorm, instrumental to fully realizing basic human rights, labor rights and human rights are largely inseparable.

This study aims to examine features of the subjective evaluation factors in labor relations for new generation employees born in the post-1980s, transitional China, and to explore the conflict reduction strategies in labor relations. This study designed items and a scale to measure employees’ subjective evaluation bias regarding labor relations, and conducted a survey of 1,500 employees in 80 Chinese enterprises. It conducted a principal components analysis of the subjective evaluation biases, and a covariance analysis to explore differences in the common factors between employees of two generations. Comparing the subjective bias with the objective status of labor relations, as well as with employers’ expectations, this study analyzed the feelings toward conflict and conflict management strategies. There are eight common factors in the subjective evaluation bias toward labor relations, four of which show significant differences between employees of two generations. Employers should study these differences, and apply conflict reduction measures to manage labor relations. This is one of the first studies to propose the concept of a subjective evaluation bias regarding labor relations, and examine the common factors and features among new generation employees. It establishes a model for feelings toward conflict through four combinations of the subjective preferences and objective status dimensions. This study offers new insights for reducing workplace conflict.","2018","2019-01-28 20:59:15","2019-01-28 20:59:15","2019-01-28 20:59:15","591-616","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","© Emerald Publishing Limited 2018","","","","ProQuest","","","","","","","Studies; Research; Labor unions; Bias; Business And Economics--Management; Conflict management; Employees; Generations; Labor contracts; Labor disputes; Labor relations; Principal components analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2015, the National Science Foundation Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NSF AGEP) California Alliance (Berkeley, Caltech, Stanford, UCLA) conducted a wide-ranging survey of graduate students across the mathematical, physical, engineering, and computer sciences in order to identify levers to improve the success of PhD students, and, in time, improve diversity in STEM leadership positions, especially the professoriate. The survey data were interpreted via path analysis, a method that identifies significant relationships, both direct and indirect, among various factors and outcomes of interest. We investigated two important outcomes: publication rates, which largely determine a new PhD student's competitiveness in the academic marketplace, and subjective well-being. Women and minority students who perceived that they were well-prepared for their graduate courses and accepted by their colleagues (faculty and fellow students), and who experienced well-articulated and structured PhD programs, were most likely to publish at rates comparable to their male majority peers. Women PhD students experienced significantly higher levels of distress than their male peers, both majority and minority, while both women and minority student distress levels were mitigated by clearly-articulated expectations, perceiving that they were well-prepared for graduate level courses, and feeling accepted by their colleagues. It is unclear whether higher levels of distress in women students is related directly to their experiences in their STEM PhD programs. The findings suggest that mitigating factors that negatively affect diversity should not, in principle, require the investment of large resources, but rather requires attention to the local culture and structure of individual STEM PhD programs. © 2019 Fisher et al.

"DVFM4BDF","book","2010","Kreber, Carolin","The University and Its Disciplines: Teaching and Learning Within and Beyond Disciplinary Boundaries","","978-1-135-89035-3","","","","University teaching and learning take place within ever more specialized disciplinary settings, each characterized by its unique traditions, concepts, practices and procedures. It is now widely recognized that support for teaching and learning needs to take this discipline-specificity into account. However, in a world characterized by rapid change, complexity and uncertainty, problems do not present themselves as distinct subjects but increasingly within trans-disciplinary contexts calling for graduate outcomes that go beyond specialized knowledge and skills. This ground-breaking book highlights the important interplay between context-specific and context-transcendent aspects of teaching, learning and assessment. It explores critical questions, such as:  What are the ‘ways of thinking and practicing’ characteristic of particular disciplines? How can students be supported in becoming participants of particular disciplinary discourse communities? Can the diversity in teaching, learning and assessment practices that we observe across departments be attributed exclusively to disciplinary structure?  To what extent do the disciplines prepare students for the complexities and uncertainties that characterize their later professional, civic and personal lives?Written for university teachers, educational developers as well as new and experienced researchers of Higher Education, this highly-anticipated first edition offers innovative perspectives from leading Canadian, US and UK scholars on how academic learning within particular disciplines can help students acquire the skills, abilities and dispositions they need to succeed academically and also post graduation.

The research also explored factors that might influence changes in reading patterns in the future, such as adoption of PDA technology. METHODOLOGY: A random sample of 2,000 AAP members was drawn from the AAP membership list, with paper surveys distributed in mid-2004. SETTINGS/SUBJECTS: Six hundred sixty-six pediatrician AAP members participated in a survey of reading behavior, with a total of 1,351 members answering some questions about technology use. RESULTS: The hypotheses that pediatricians read many journal articles each month, read each article on average quite quickly, read heavily from personal subscriptions, read from both print and electronic journals, and read for many purposes were all supported. Pediatricians read journal articles primarily for current awareness and most often rely on quick reading from print journals for current awareness. Reading for research, writing, and presentations are more likely from library-provided electronic journals. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Convenience and purpose of reading are key factors that explain reading patterns of pediatricians. Print personal subscriptions are convenient for current awareness reading, while electronic journals systems are convenient for reading for research because they provide access to a broader range of journals. Publishers and librarians must understand the purposes and patterns of reading to design appropriate journals and services. Pediatricians read many current articles very quickly and from many different locations. Pediatricians under the age of thirty-five are more likely to use PDAs, suggesting that articles delivered to a handheld device might be accepted as convenient in the future.","2007-01","2019-02-19 21:00:34","2019-02-19 21:00:34","","56-63","","1","95","","J Med Libr Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17252067 PMCID: PMC1773049","<p>done - no good info</p> <p> </p>","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17252067","","Internet; Humans; United States; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Journalism, Medical; Pediatrics; Physicians; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Medical faculty of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) multi-campus system were surveyed, and their responses estimated using critical incident technique to characterize the different aspects of their use of print and electronic journals. RESULTS: Medical faculty read a great deal, especially compared to scientists. The most frequently reported principal purpose of reading is to support their primary research (30% of reading). The majority of reading comes from recently published articles, mostly from personal subscriptions. Medical faculty continue to rely on print journals (approximately 70% of readings) versus electronic journals. Age of faculty does not appear to influence the choice of print or electronic format. Medical faculty read more articles than others on average and need information digested and verified in a way to save them time. Convenience and currency are highly valued attributes. CONCLUSIONS: It can be asserted that librarians and publishers must find ways to provide the attributes of convenience and currency and match the portability of personal subscriptions in an electronic journal format for medical faculty.","2004-04","2019-02-19 21:03:07","2019-02-19 21:03:07","","233-241","","2","92","","J Med Libr Assoc","Medical faculty's use of print and electronic journals","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15098053 PMCID: PMC385305","<p>done - no good info</p>","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15098053","","Librarians; Library Services; Female; Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; United States; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Journalism, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Faculty, Medical; Libraries, Medical; Periodicals as Topic; Professional Competence; Professional Role; Tennessee; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to begin to develop data on this subject with convenience samples of 62 clinical faculty members at one U.S. dental school and a group of 33 dental editors. Members of the two groups were surveyed about their interest in and familiarity with a sample of items from the Journal of the American Dental Association and the ADA News, including research articles, editorials, advertisements, and announcements about programs and people. The participants also completed a multiple-choice test about the essential feature of each item, a measure that reflected the degree of retention of content from reading prior to the study. The results showed that both groups had the greatest interest in content that presented scientific findings or responsible opinion. By contrast, they rated the advertisements and announcements as uninteresting and did not recall their content well. Based on the findings that reading an item produced better recall if the item was of interest, a hierarchical model for learning from the literature is hypothesized, one that is supported by the social psychology literature.","2015-09","2019-02-19 21:03:46","2019-02-19 21:03:46","","1061-1065","","9","79","","J Dent Educ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26329030","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26329030","","Learning; Humans; faculty development; Attitude of Health Personnel; Periodicals as Topic; Advertising as Topic; Comprehension; continuing dental education; dental education; dental faculty; Faculty, Dental; Mental Recall; Publishing; reading; Reading; reading comprehension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Faculty members in different disciplines exhibit quite distinct patterns of reading. Medical/health faculty read more than others and mainly for current awareness purposes, while engineering faculty spend more time on average per article reading, and they also read more for research. Other factors that influence some reading patterns include work responsibilities (weighted towards more teaching or more research), age (young faculty are more likely to read on-screen from the open Web) and productivity of the reader, and purpose of the reading (readings for research and writing are more likely to be from a library collection).

We evaluated recommendations of editorial board members for acceptance/rejection using a four-tier system, agreement with editor's final decision, turnaround time from review request to submission, and editors' grades of reviews on a 5-point scale. We evaluated the performance of editorial board members with advancing tenure, seeking trends in recommendations over time.Results: We included 6062 manuscript reviews representing 5958 manuscripts; 67% were assigned to male editorial board members and 33% to females. There were 38 editorial board members (25 men, 13 women) with tenure duration from 2 to 4.9 years, and 3 editors (2 men, 1 woman) serving 7, 7, and 6 years, respectively. Women were less likely to accept or accept with minor revisions than men (p < 0.003). Median turnaround times were 14 (0–55) days for women and 10 (0–33) days for men (p < 0.001). The editors' grades assigned to women were more often than men's grades in the very good to exceptional category (p < 0.0001). There was no difference based on gender, with approximately 73% decision congruence overall with the editors' final decisions. Men rejected more manuscripts than did women with advancing tenure on the editorial board (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: There are differences based on gender of editorial board members' recommendations about manuscript triage, turnaround time, and editors' grades assigned. Overall, however, these differences do not affect editors' ultimate decisions about manuscript publication.","2010-09-11","2019-02-19 21:52:40","2019-07-23 18:38:06","2019-02-19 21:52:40","1919-1923","","10","19","","Journal of Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","liebertpub.com (Atypon)","","","<p>first author</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\IAZNZYTY\Wing et al. - 2010 - Differences in Editorial Board Reviewer Behavior B.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WVDWMXU2\jwh.2009.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3NMGTIPA\jwh.2009.html","","","UNITED States; AUTHORSHIP; COMPARATIVE studies; CORPORATE turnaround management; CORRELATION (Statistics); DECISION making; EDITORS; GYNECOLOGY; LONGITUDINAL method; MANUSCRIPTS; MEDICAL personnel; OBSTETRICS; ONLINE education; PEER review (Professional performance); PRODUCTION scheduling; PROMOTIONS; PUBLISHERS & publishing; SCALE items; SEX differences (Biology); SEX distribution; TIME; WOMEN -- United States; WOMEN'S health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a very complete database of funding, scientific papers and citations compiled at the individual researchers’ level, we estimate panel data regressions on the discipline-normalised citation rates of individual academics in Quebec. Our results show that although most of the indicators examined have a positive influence on the relative citation rate, when it comes to gender differences, not having enough public funding and raising private funding appear slightly detrimental for women in the health sciences. In addition, when women collaborate with the same number of co-authors as men, or target similar Impact Factor journals, their articles are less cited then those of their male colleagues. Almost no gender effect is found in the natural sciences and engineering where women are still a minority. Our results worryingly show that academics who publish with a larger proportion of female co-authors are less cited. Furthermore, when targeting similar Impact Factor journals, researchers who collaborate with a higher proportion of female co-authors are consistently less cited in both the health and NSE fields than if they were publishing with a male dominated group of co-authors.","2016-11-01","2019-02-19 21:53:58","2019-02-19 21:53:58","2019-02-19 21:53:58","1790-1817","","9","45","","Research Policy","Which gender gap?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>done</p>; <p>first author</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\UQK3SEN2\S004873331630083X.html","","","Gender; Citations; Impact Factor; Research funding; Scientific production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With evidence that students struggle to grasp Boolean searching, and may not use it even after instruction, it could be left out of first-year instruction, freeing up valuable class time to focus on concepts such as question development and source evaluation.

To test this model, a web-based survey, which included both closed and open-ended questions, was administered to 337 business students. Findings indicate that the ILI received by students is beneficial in the initial or early stages of OLR use; however, students quickly reach a saturation point where more instruction contributes little, if anything, to the final outcome, such as reduced OLR anxiety and increased OLR self-efficacy. Rather, it is the independent, continuous use of OLR after receiving initial, formal ILI that creates continued positive effects. Importantly, OLR self-efficacy and anxiety were found to be important antecedents to OLR adoption. OLR anxiety also partially mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and perceived ease of use.

Design/methodology/approach - Students were surveyed regarding the types of business course assignments that require research and the number of sources which must be cited for these research projects. The information-seeking behaviors of business students used in gathering these sources were examined, looking at where these students began their research, which tools they used, and the challenges they faced in conducting research. The paper also investigated the students' preferred methods of seeking assistance in completing their research, as well as how they evaluated the credibility of sources they uncovered. Findings - Student research requirements for homework assignments were fairly evenly distributed between very often/often and sometimes/never. Overall, students noted that presentations required research very often or often. Only 2.35 percent reported no research for short papers, with graduate students representing the largest group who indicated no research required for short papers. By contrast, 81 percent of seniors responded that they conducted research for short papers either very often or often.

The study researched the influence of information literacy on student success in higher education. Methodology/approach: The study is based on a sample of 197 regular undergraduate students, and the results were analyzed by using the multiple regression analysis. Results: The results show that proficiency in searching for information sources positively influences students' success. Within the component Search, the influence of effective search procedures and the ability to master bibliographic sources on students' success were measured. Research limitation: The study was limited to four components of IL (Theoretical knowledge, Search, Evaluation and Use of information), and the sample included students of economic and business sciences. Originality/practical implications: It was concluded that information literacy should be an integral part of the ongoing learning process and its effects should be constantly tested and improved.

Recent studies indicate that online research guides are generally not helpful to college students unless the guides are linked to a course, either by being a course page or by being accompanied by an instruction session with the librarian. In this article, we report the findings of a study where students in a medium–sized (25 student), upper–division business course were asked about the helpfulness of a course page, the helpfulness of the librarian's accompanying instruction session, and how much they used the page. The student survey used mostly Likert scale questions. The study also reports on the course page's link traffic. Our results confirm earlier findings that a course page used in conjunction with librarian instruction is an effective tool to enhance student research. There were no control groups, and all respondents received both course page and instruction session. Seventy–one percent of the respondents indicated that the course page helpfulness ranged between “somewhat” and “very helpful,” and less than 10% of respondents said that they would not recommend a course page to other classes. Link traffic results indicate that neither a business subject guide nor a legal subject guide would have been as helpful to the respondents. These results support the argument that course pages should be preferred to subject guides when feasible.","2013-04","2019-02-22 20:03:12","2019-07-23 18:40:29","","127-138","","2","18","","Internet Reference Services Quarterly","The Library Course Page and Instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p>","; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\EUWGTW63\Leighton and May - 2013 - The Library Course Page and Instruction Perceived.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MZXIHQAE\10875301.2013.html","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=llf&AN=90244127&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","College students; Surveys; Internet; academic libraries; Universities & colleges; Business; Databases; Student attitudes; Library orientation; Scale analysis (Psychology); college students; course pages; information literacy, surveys; pathfinders; research guides; websites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After receiving funding from their institution's internal teaching innovation fund, they hired and worked with two eLearning design companies to produce the toolkit. The toolkit includes videos and PDF resources that show students how to retrieve specialized resources for key business research tasks. The librarians undertook this project to increase the online business information literacy offerings at their university and better support their institution's diverse commuter, distance, and part-time student population. To develop a student-centered toolkit, the librarians used a curriculum mapping exercise, online surveying, focus groups, usability tests, and a student review group. They also adapted the ADDIE instructional design model and consulted adult learning theory to develop a series of micro-learning supports that were relevant and useful for undergraduate and graduate business students.","2018-07","2019-02-22 20:04:25","2019-04-23 18:42:31","","71-89","","3/4","12","","Journal of Library & Information Services in Distance Learning","Building BRYT","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p>","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=134609622&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","higher education; Students; Librarians; Internet; Educational technology; information literacy; Business; Information literacy; Information resources; ADDIE; adult learning theory application; business education; business information literacy; business students; case study; Computer assisted instruction; Curricula (Courses of study); eLearning; Learning strategies; micro-learning support; online learning; School environment; student-centred approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some published studies included small numbers of business school faculty and graduate students in their samples, but provided little, if any, insight into variations within the business discipline. Business researchers employ a variety of research designs and data collection methods and engage in quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The purpose of this paper is to provide deeper insight into primary and secondary data use by business graduate students at one Canadian university based on a content analysis of a corpus of 32 Master of Science in Management theses. This paper explores variations in research designs and data collection methods between and within business subfields (e.g., accounting, finance, operations and information systems, marketing, or organization studies) in order to better understand the extent to which these researchers collect and analyze primary data or secondary data sources, including commercial or open data sources. The results of this analysis will inform the work of data specialists and liaison librarians who provide research data management services for business school researchers.","2015-06","2019-02-22 20:05:12","2019-04-23 18:45:25","","14-25","","2","39","","IASSIST Quarterly","Bridging the Business Data Divide","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p>","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=111932373&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","Academic librarians; graduate students; Business & education; business; Digital divide; primary data; RESEARCH; research data management; secondary data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, the study analyses how well the online IL tutorial, with its focus on combining instructional videos with active learning exercises, performs in delivering content related to different elements of IL, as defined by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL 2010). The findings indicate that the online IL tutorial is more effective for some skills than for others, suggesting that it will be beneficial to explore different instructional designs in collaboration with academic staff to improve the current IL tutorial in these areas.

A population of undergraduate business students (N=355) and online MBA students (N=319) were introduced to a Literature Review library guide during specific points in their programs. Students were asked to complete an online survey that included 17 closed-ended items designed to measure perceived usefulness, satisfaction and likeliness to use the guide again. The survey also included two open-ended questions asking students to discuss those elements of the guide they found most valuable and whether they wanted any additional features included in the guide. The data collection strategy required faculty post information about the Literature Review library guide and the survey in their courses at two specified times in the course. A low response rate (3.5%) may have resulted from inconsistencies in how faculty shared information about the guide and the study in their courses. Although the small sample size (n=24) limited the planned analysis, and results indicated no statistical significance between groups, descriptive findings were reported, and trends were used to revise the resource and inform future development of library research guides. Overall, students reported being satisfied with the resource and found it usable. Graduate students were more likely to report elements of the guide that supported effective search and evaluation strategies were valuable; whereas, undergraduate students tended to value the links to writing resources. Student feedback also suggested that the earlier the guide was introduced in the program, the more likely students would use the resource. Adopting a model that embeds resource guides early in academic programs and aligns guide content with the curriculum should lead to increased use of the resource.","2017-06-02","2019-02-22 20:12:40","2019-04-23 18:43:32","2019-02-22 20:12:40","135-150","","3","21","","Online Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>done</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MGJIFL7I\Brewer et al. - 2017 - Improving Digital Library Experiences and Support .pdf","","","Graduate students; Digital libraries; Electronic reserve collections in libraries; Information services; Literature reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students completed the Evaluative Threat in STEM Scale (Ahlqvist, London, & Rosenthal, 2013) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) at six intervals. Cross-sectional and longitudinal measurement invariance was supported. Women reported greater evaluative threat than men, but they did not differ from men in difficulties regulating emotion. Both constructs showed moderate relative stability over time. Using latent change score analyses, significant positive deceleration change patterns indicated that four of the emotion regulation difficulties (Lack of Emotional Awareness, Lack of Emotional Clarity, Impulse Control Difficulties, and Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses) and evaluative threat tended to increase (worsen) over the year, but the increases also slowed (i.e., plateaued) over time. Compared with men, women initially reported higher evaluative threat than men did, but these differences decreased over the year, as women decelerated more quickly than men did. In terms of cross-coupling effects, we found that evaluative threat was associated with subsequent difficulty in identifying strategies to cope with unpleasant emotions. There were no cross-coupling effects for emotion regulation predicting subsequent change in evaluative threat. Gender moderated the Evaluative Threat-to-DERS coupling effects for Lack of Emotional Clarity, Difficulties in Goal-Directed Behavior, and Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses. We discuss implications of evaluative threat for depleting coping resources and some potential psychoeducational and preventive interventions to support students in STEM majors.

As such, there has been an increased interest in interventions to reduce bias against, and increase inclusion of, women in STEM. In this paper, we compare and contrast two commonly used strategies: awareness and blindness. We demonstrate that gender-blindness—a diversity ideology that advocates for downplaying gender differences, rather than embracing them—has the potential to diminish stereotyping of women in STEM fields. In six total studies, we show that men who believe, or are primed with, gender-blindness (compared to gender-awareness) are less likely to endorse gender stereotypes around women's STEM competencies. By measuring (Study 1) and manipulating (Studies 2–5) gender-blindness, we show that gender-blindness (compared to awareness) minimizes the gender gap on explicit stereotyping measures, as well as diminishes STEM stereotyping in target evaluations. Across six studies, we show the influence of diversity ideologies on stereotyping of women in STEM.","2019-01-23","2019-02-25 16:34:41","2019-02-25 16:34:48","2019-02-25 16:34:41","","","","","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Blind to bias","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\VJ9UTIPT\Martin and Phillips - 2019 - Blind to bias The benefits of gender-blindness fo.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\V68FEASW\S0022103117305589.html","","","STEM; Gender; Diversity ideologies; Gender-blindness; Stereotyping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two interventions attempt to address the concern for the reason why women quit CS field-one, women are more inclined to solve real world problems either in the scientific or social field that can benefit humanity; and two, women are dependent on social networking and more inclined to share their feelings with others when compared to men. We verified both hypotheses by creating a Facebook discussion group among consented students in the introductory courses and replacing the traditional assignments with the ones that are designed closer to real-life problem in Fall 2015. By the end of the semester, we surveyed our participants to examine the effect of the two interventions. According to the results we got from our research, we can conclude that both building the online discussion platform and using more practical examples will help increase women's interest in studying computer science.

This engagement is especially evident in the Historically Black College and University (HBCU) context as senior administrators’ engagement with students can directly or indirectly affect how students perceive themselves and their ability to succeed. This article aims to illuminate the role that HBCU senior level administrators play in students’ motivation toward success. We also highlight the notion that senior level administrators’ role in organizational culture ultimately led historically-disempowered Black women students toward success in even the most historically inaccessible pathways in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The study used semi-structured interviews with 71 Black women STEM students across 10 HBCUs and asked questions to better understand how events in their lives and on their campuses shaped their choice to pursue and persist through a STEM degree program. The study found that the women were highly motivated by their HBCUs’ family-like community of support. Integral to this article, this support was not confined to professors and peers, but extended to senior administrators. We conclude that Black women STEM students’ perception of their ability to succeed and their motivation is influenced by the institutions’ senior administration.","2018-06","2019-02-25 15:59:34","2019-02-25 15:59:34","2019-02-25 15:59:34","48","","2","8","","","Senior Level Administrators and HBCUs","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JBBWVN79\Washington Lockett et al. - 2018 - Senior Level Administrators and HBCUs The Role of.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\84ZVRVPD\48.html","","","engagement; administrators; HBCU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First developed in USA, STEM education has been attempted in several countries, both in the public and the private education systems. The data, however, shows that the number of students interested in these topics is small and decreasing, with special impact on women and minorities. This paper summarizes the main trends in the integration of STEM in school systems, and identifies the three fundamental obstacles for its successful implementation: a) the curriculum in math is obsolete, and therefore physics, chemistry and biology are studied with obsolete tools and perspective; b) students are not educated in the resolution of complex problems that require higher level mental processes, involving higher level cognitive modules, globally known as System-1; and c) students still use pencil and paper to solve problems, while complex problems need for their resolution and iterative process of experimentation and discovery that requires external micro-worlds or ecosystems for their implementation and manipulation. This paper also proposes a set of curricular strategies to address these three fundamental obstacles. Specifically, this paper presents six areas of interdisciplinary curricular development for the successful integration of STEM education. A set of examples are used to illustrate the main constituents of these strategies and the implications on students' performance. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","2018","2019-02-25 15:59:16","2019-04-08 19:36:33","","169-175","","","","","","","","","","","","Bali, Indonesia","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\VYE3AW7Y\display.html","","","STEM Education; Computing; Complex Systems; Computational Theory of the Mind; New approaches to problem solving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICEEL 2018 Proceedings of the 2018 2nd International Conference on Education and E-Learning Pages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It tests predictions from balanced identity theory on the relations between implicit STEM gender stereotypes and implicit STEM identity, as well as predictions from the associative-propositional model related to exposure to counter-stereotypical exemplars in a sample of U.S. college-aged heterosexual romantic couples that varied in whether the woman majored in STEM or in female-dominated majors (FDM). Gender-STEM stereotypes and Self-STEM identification, as measured by Implicit Associations Tasks, were examined in 117 college women majoring in STEM or in FDM and in their romantic partners, some of whom were also majoring in STEM. Women in STEM majors evidenced stronger STEM identities while also demonstrating reduced Gender/STEM stereotypes in comparison to women in FDM and men in STEM. For women, implicit STEM stereotypes predicted implicit STEM identity which in turn predicted majoring in STEM, consistent with predictions from balanced identity theory. There was no support for the hypothesis that men’s exposure to counter-stereotypical women through their romantic relationships influenced their own implicit stereotypes, inconsistent with the associative-propositional model. Women in STEM fields and their romantic partners also evidenced more similar levels of STEM gender stereotypes when compared to the other couples. Dissemination of these results may encourage other STEM-talented women in similar pursuits. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2019","2019-02-25 15:58:19","2019-05-22 14:17:08","","","","","","","","Career Stereotypes and Identities","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\538S3WZZ\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MT2W8YK8\Dunlap and Barth - 2019 - Career Stereotypes and Identities Implicit Belief.pdf","","Identity; STEM majors; Academic specialization (major); Couples; Gender roles; Implicit; Romantic relationships; Sex roles; Stereotyped attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fields such as physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science (PEMC) are thought to require talent or brilliance. However, the potential effects of difficulty perceptions on students&rsquo; participation in STEM have yet to be examined using a gender and race/ethnicity intersectional lens. Using nationally representative U.S. longitudinal data, we measure gender and racial/ethnic variation in secondary students&rsquo; orientation towards mathematics difficulty. We observed nuanced relationships between mathematics difficulty orientation, gender, race/ethnicity, and PEMC major and degree outcomes. In secondary school, the gap between boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; mathematics difficulty orientations were wider than gaps between White and non-White students. Mathematics difficulty orientation was positively associated with both declaring majors and earning degrees in PEMC. This relationship varied more strongly based on gender than race/ethnicity. Notably, Black women show higher gains in predicted probability to declare a mathematics-intensive major as compared to all other women, given their mathematics difficulty orientations. This study&rsquo;s findings show that both gender and racial/ethnic identities may influence the relationship between mathematics difficulty orientation and postsecondary STEM outcomes.","2019-02","2019-02-25 15:57:39","2019-02-25 15:57:50","2019-02-25 15:57:39","43","","2","8","","","Difficulty Orientations, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KYRVVDSZ\Nix and Perez-Felkner - 2019 - Difficulty Orientations, Gender, and RaceEthnicit.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NMIB9L6Z\43.html","","","higher education; gender; STEM education; intersectionality; ability beliefs; race and ethnicity; STEM degrees; URM students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why does the underrepresentation of women endure? This study investigated the role of parenthood as a mechanism of gender-differentiated attrition from STEM employment. Using a nationally representative 8-year longitudinal sample of US STEM professionals, we examined the career trajectories of new parents after the birth or adoption of their first child. We found substantial attrition of new mothers: 43% of women leave full-time STEM employment after their first child. New mothers are more likely than new fathers to leave STEM, to switch to part-time work, and to exit the labor force. These gender differences hold irrespective of variation by discipline, race, and other demographic factors. However, parenthood is not just a “mother’s problem”; 23% of new fathers also leave STEM after their first child. Suggesting the difficulty of combining STEM work with caregiving responsibilities generally, new parents are more likely to leave full-time STEM jobs than otherwise similar childless peers and even new parents who remain employed full time are more likely than their childless peers to exit STEM for work elsewhere. These results have implications for policymakers and STEM workforce scholars; whereas parenthood is an important mechanism of women’s attrition, both women and men leave at surprisingly high rates after having children. Given that most people become parents during their working lives, STEM fields must do more to retain professionals with children.","2019-02-13","2019-03-01 13:58:28","2019-03-01 13:58:28","2019-03-01 13:58:28","201810862","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

This mixed-methods study uses a concurrent, nested design to study an online homework intervention designed to address choice and achievement. A choice of three different contexts (biological, sports, and traditional) were offered to students for each physics problem, intending to stimulate females’ interest and enhance achievement. Informed by aspects of Artino’s social-cognitive model of academic motivation and emotion, we investigated: Which context of physics problems do males and females select?; What explanations do students give for their choices?; Are there differences in the achievement of males and females?; and Is there a relationship between student achievement and the context selected? Fifty-two high school physics students from five U.S. states participated. Data included pre and post Force Concept Inventory scores, homework context choices and achievement, and rationales for choices. Findings indicate that females were most likely to select biology contexts; males, traditional. All students made more attempts on video questions over word questions, although females did not score as well. For all questions, students generally persisted until they answered them correctly, with females taking fewer attempts on problems. Context choice was mostly driven by interest, for males, and perceptions of difficulty level for females; however, rationales were indistinguishable by gender. On their first homework question attempt, females scored significantly better than the males. Initially, males had significantly higher FCI scores; post homework intervention, females increased their mean scores significantly on the FCI, erasing the initial gender gap, with no growth nor decline in males’ scores. Females with FCI growth were equally as likely to choose biology contexts as traditional contexts; males were more likely to choose biology contexts. Findings from this study suggest that modest changes to homework problems that provide choice and make the physics problems more contextually interesting - even without changes in classroom instruction - could increase interest and motivation students and increase achievement for both male and female students. Recommendations will be discussed.","2019","2019-04-02 18:49:18","2019-04-02 18:49:18","2019-04-02 18:49:18","","","","10","","Front.

But recent work has offered a unifying explanation for gender representation across the STEM/non­STEM divide. This proposed explanation, called the field­specific ability beliefs (FAB) hypothesis, postulates that, in combination with pervasive stereotypes that link men but not women with intellectual talent, academics perpetuate female underrepresentation by transmitting to students in earlier stages of education their beliefs about how much intellectual talent is required for success in each academic field. This theory was supported by a national survey which found that the disciplines with the fewest women had practitioners who were most likely to think that success in their field requires [talent]/[brilliance]. We test this top­down schema with a nationwide survey of U.S. undergraduates, assessing the extent to which undergraduate beliefs about talent in academia mirror those of academics. We find no evidence that academics transmit their beliefs to undergraduates. We also use a second survey – identical to the first but with each field’s gender ratio provided as added information – to explicitly test the relationship between undergraduate beliefs about gender and talent in academia. The results for this second survey suggest that the extent to which undergraduates rate brilliance as essential to success in an academic field is highly sensitive to this added information for non­STEM fields, but not STEM fields. Overall, our study offers evidence that, contrary to FAB hypothesis, the STEM/non­STEM divide principally shapes undergraduate beliefs about both gender and talent in academia.","2019","2019-04-02 18:53:09","2019-04-02 18:53:09","2019-04-02 18:53:09","","","","4","","Front.

It is found that the two genders did not differ in their intentions to depart from academia, but women faculty had a significantly higher likelihood to change positions within academia. The indications are that women and men are equally committed to their academic careers in STEM; nonetheless, women’s stronger turnover intentions are highly correlated with dissatisfaction with research support, advancement opportunities, and free expression of ideas. The findings suggest that the underrepresentation of women is more convincingly explained by an academic culture that provides women fewer opportunities, limited support, and inequity in leadership, rather than by gender-based differences such as roles in family responsibilities.

One of its major benefits is that it enables students to become actively involved in the learning and assessment process and play an integral role in the delivery and quality of their education. However, a primary concern is that students do not consistently provide each other with quality feedback, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in which gender stereotypes may hinder the ability of women to provide critical peer feedback. A potential way to improve peer feedback is to create anonymous review settings. This study examines how anonymity alters the nature of peer feedback in a large introductory undergraduate statistics class for computer science and engineering majors. In this class, peers review a series of team video projects as either anonymous or nonanonymous reviewers.

Various approaches have attempted to diversify the pipeline into these fields. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 45 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university in the US, we find that students have benefitted from programs aimed at recruiting women, and people of color, into STEM. Feminist approaches to raise awareness about gender gaps in STEM have enabled students to recognize gender differences, but they have not gone far enough yet. Rather than understanding and problematizing gendered power dynamics in the classroom, lab, and workplace, students espouse what we call ‘STEMinism’: an individualistic lens that, in many ways, asks women in STEM to recognize the problem and fix it for themselves. Improving the representation of women, and people of color, in STEM requires a concentrated critique and interruption of the structural forces that perpetuate sex-segregation in STEM.

We also consider whether gender moderates how each facet of the departmental environment relates to work-to-life conflict. Data are from STEM faculty at a midsized university located in the Upper Midwest (N = 114 faculty members). The findings indicated that both psychological safety and perceived injustice were significantly associated with the dependent variable. We found no evidence of gender moderating these relationships.

While some interventions showed positive effects on a variety of motivational constructs and academic outcomes, others showed mixed or non-significant effects. We recommend that researchers more frequently examine moderating variables that might limit interventions’ results, including individual-level variables such as gender, contextual-level variables such as the subject in which an intervention was conducted, and design-level variables such as intervention length. Additionally, researchers might better align their interventions with motivation theory.

With evidence that students struggle to grasp Boolean searching, and may not use it even after instruction, it could be left out of first‐year instruction, freeing up valuable class time to focus on concepts such as question development and source evaluation.

Survey data were collected from 404 female undergraduate engineering students from two mid-sized universities in the Western U.S. and analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Results suggested that women’s engineering identity centrality, or the importance they placed on being engineering students to their self-concept, was beneficial for their perceived persistence in the field; whereas their gender identity centrality, or the importance they placed on being women, was problematic. However, identity management partially mitigated these associations. Engineering identity centrality predicted social recategorization, which is characterized by blending in with men and de-emphasizing one’s gender. In contrast, gender identity centrality predicted positive distinctiveness, a strategy that is typified by attempts to improve men’s perceptions of women. Social recategorization had no apparent benefits as an identity management strategy, whereas positive distinctiveness indirectly predicted increased likelihood of persistence via self-efficacy. The implications of these two strategies are discussed. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2019-04-19 15:53:21","2019-04-19 15:53:21","","339-360","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\72KN59TA\display.html","","","Self-efficacy; Persistence; College engineering; Gender microaggressions; Identity centrality; Positive distinctiveness; Social recategorization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These constructs suggest that having parity in the number of men and women in an engineering institution is not sufficient for creating equitable environments for men and women to thrive. © 2018 IEEE.","2019","2019-04-19 15:55:42","2019-07-23 18:38:43","","","","","2018-October","","","Going beyond Gender Balance","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\4ECHWGZV\8658912.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ZZMCDWEG\Brucker et al. - 2018 - Going Beyond Gender Balance Understanding the Int.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\Q8VSKVGF\display.html","","","STEM; engineering education; gender issues; Engineering education; Cultural differences; computer aided instruction; Encoding; engineering alumni; engineering environments; engineering institution; gender balance; gender-balanced educational environment; grounded theory approach; Interviews; post-graduate experiences; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women are no longer underrepresented in the biological sciences degree programs, earning more than half of undergraduate degrees in these fields in 2016 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). Despite women’s heightened interest in the biomedical fields, little is known about the backgrounds, characteristics, and personality orientations of undergraduates who major in biological sciences or how this differs by gender. Utilizing national data spanning four decades, this study furthers our understanding of the biological sciences talent pool in the following ways: (1) it explores differences in the characteristics of women and men who plan to major in the biological sciences, and (2) examines how this population has evolved over time. The results of this study reveal the types of students who are attracted to biological science majors (e.g., having a parent in a STEM career or having PhD degree aspirations) and show that the salience of some of these traits (e.g., race and self-rated math ability) vary by gender and have shifted over time. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.","2018","2019-04-19 15:57:15","2019-07-23 18:40:10","","291-324","","4","24","","","Reversal of the gender gap","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\V858IEBA\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\LIS79PMZ\00551c876cc2f027,024da55e7e21d2ce,5afc344c663210dd.html","","","STEM; Gender; Biological sciences; College major; Major selection; Undergraduate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS A. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled 'Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education' that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course. © 2018 IEEE.","2019","2019-04-19 15:59:02","2019-07-23 18:40:06","","","","","2018-October","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6IML92WQ\8659237.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\CM4U9IF5\Joshi and Jain - 2018 - Reflecting on the Impact of a Course on Inclusive .pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\DP52GC48\display.html","","","STEM; computer science education; Industries; Programming; educational courses; computer aided instruction; AP CS A; AP CS principles; computational thinking concepts; Computer science education; computer science teaching; greater Boise Metropolitan region; Inclusive Strategies; inclusive strategies for computer science education course; teaching; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology (ECST) currently has a female enrollment of only 15%, which is below the national average of 20%. The College has set a goal of increasing the percentage of women to 25% by 2025. The recruitment program described in this paper is one of the strategies the ECST will use to reach its goal. The objectives of the recruitment program, LAunchPad, were to increase the students' interest in engineering and computer science, and to achieve a 50% participant matriculation rate into the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology. LAunchPad established a gender-inclusive learning environment, with scaffolded instruction and hands-on activities to reinforce the learning. The students were also introduced to two groups of female role models; the first group was early-career alumni that held technical positions with local companies, and the second group was mid- to senior-level engineers, computer scientists, and executives. A post-event survey revealed that the students' interest in pursuing an engineering or computer science career increased by 29%; seventy percent applied for admission to the University for the following Fall. Results suggest that contributing factors to the students' increased interest are an increased understanding of engineering and computer science, increased confidence, access to diverse role models, and the ability to establish peer networks.","2018-10","2019-04-19 15:59:50","2019-04-19 15:59:50","","1-8","","","","","","LAunchPad","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ETLS4JTI\8659097.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\B87UTTPR\DeMatteis et al. - 2018 - LAunchPad The Design and Evaluation of a STEM Rec.pdf","","","STEM; engineering education; educational institutions; Engineering profession; gender issues; computer science education; Recruitment; recruitment; Programming; educational courses; College of Engineering Computer Science and Technology; Data science; ECST; LAunchPad; Python; Robots; STEM recruitment program; young women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With contributions from library and information professionals, this volume explores how librarians and library professionals can embrace a more proactive role as social justice advocates, and help promote fairness, justice, equality, equity, and activism on behalf of LGBTQ+ people. Starting within the library space, the volume offers an introduction to terminology and resources around LGBTQ+ information, before moving on to explore examples of how LGBTQ+ librarianship can adopt innovative approaches to better serve their patrons in select settings around the world. Including case studies on health services, historical archives, and LGBTQ+ homelessness, this collection dispels misperceptions and myths surrounding social justice research and is vital for any researcher or practitioner interested in supporting evolving communities.","2019-05-01","2019-05-08 19:36:39","2019-05-08 19:36:44","","","324","","","","","LGBTQ+ Librarianship in the 21st Century","","","","","Emerald Group Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JhOUDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com/books?id=JhOUDwAAQBAJ","","Language Arts & Disciplines / Library & Information Science / Administration & Management; Language Arts & Disciplines / Library & Information Science / General; Social Science / LGBT Studies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.","2019-06-03","2019-06-07 13:03:11","2019-07-23 18:39:00","2019-06-07 13:03:11","","","","","","Sex Roles","How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advancement of Scholars in STEM","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NJ5MKFM3\Eaton et al. - 2019 - How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advance.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\47JLR9IU\s11199-019-01052-w.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\H3G3JSET\Eaton et al. - 2019 - How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advance.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3XF4V3F6\Eaton et al. - 2019 - How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advance.pdf","","","STEM; Prejudice; Gender gap; Intersectionality; Academic settings; Racial discrimination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that identity interference related to greater emotional exhaustion, greater cynicism, and lower academic efficacy. A chillier climate related to more emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Furthermore, a positive relation was found between woman–scientist interference and cynicism when chilly climate was low or moderate. When interference was high, chilly climate did not have a relation with cynicism. When women experienced many threats (i.e., high chilly climate, high interference), they reached a threshold where additional emotional cost did not matter.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper used systematic review and inter-rater reliability of the literature of business information research instruction to test two attributes of research quality: the evidence-based levels of evidence and the EBLIP critical analysis checklist. Findings - Intervention questions and case studies are the most popular research methods on the EBL levels of evidence scale. The majority of articles score below 75 on the EBLIP critical appraisal checklist. Prediction questions are represented by higher levels of evidence and study quality. Intervention questions paired with the cohort design and exploratory questions paired with survey design indicate strong areas of research quality. The case study method, while most popular, showes lower scores across all question types yet revealed some high-quality benchmark examples. Research limitations/implications - Error is possible when distinguishing between cohort and case study - some articles may fall into one or the other study design. Rater training was conducted only once, and best practices for inter-rater reliability recommend multiple rounds to achieve higher rater agreement. Practical implications - Recommendations are presented for ways to improve the evidence base of research articles and suggest areas for professional development opportunities for librarian researchers wishing to increase the quality of research publications. Originality/value - The paper goes beyond the narrative review of the literature of business instruction to measure the research methods employed in those publications against two evidence-based standards. The results will show where the literature stands as a maturing discipline and provide recommendations for increasing the levels of evidence for future research.","2010-08","2019-07-19 14:26:45","2019-07-19 14:26:45","","385-397","","3","38","","Reference Services Review","Systematic review of research methods","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","http://search.ebscohost.com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=60972036&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","Academic libraries; Academic librarians; Research methodology evaluation; Business education; Academic library research; Business literature; Higher education research; Research methods; Statistical reliability; Textbooks -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate a significant statistical difference in the online exercise scores between those students who attended the corresponding session versus those who were absent. Although there was a trend for students attending all three library instruction sessions to have higher mean rankings on the research memo assignment than those who did not; this trend was not significant.

To ensure uniformity of course content, delivery and student faculty interaction in face to face, hybrid or pure online courses, these agencies provide standards that the units must satisfy and demand a thorough explanation of the processes in place that ensure success of this particular standard. Thus, a School of Business seeking to branch out from a traditional classroom style MBA degree to additional online options for student coursework have to be mindful of the quality and mode of instruction as well as the course material and student contact that is provided in the online version of any course. The content has to be similar, the faculty has to provide enough evidence of interaction with students, and the modes of assessment as well as the assessment instruments have to be similar in the different versions of the class. In this paper, we describe two versions of the same class - an MBA level Managerial Economics class that is offered both online and in class. In this instance, the two sections were offered concurrently. We describe the course material delivery formats in the two courses, as well as the student assignments and the faculty student interaction. Finally we provide an idea of the student feedback especially in the online course, as well as student performance. In the paper we make the case that even a historically challenging subject like Economics taught at the Masters (MBA) level can be offered online in a satisfactory manner without compromising any aspect of student learning.","2017","2019-07-19 14:05:56","2019-07-19 14:05:56","2019-07-19 14:05:55","17-17","","1","20","","Allied Academies International Conference: Proceedings of the Academy for Economics & Economic Education (AEEE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\YRAEDPZX\Ghosh - 2017 - A Comparison of Online Versus in Person Delivery o.pdf","","","Education; Online education; Business students; Business schools; Master of business administration degree; Managerial economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research was focused on evaluating the efficacy, measured by student performance, of undergraduate business statistics courses taught online classes, as compared to traditional, face-to-face classes and web-enhanced courses. Are there differences in how male and female students perform in both class formats? Performance in the classroom is traditionally measured by the grades, namely the final grade. This study looked at the impact of online learning facilities in a course with traditionally difficult content for undergraduates with regard to gender. Results found that students overall performed better in face-to-face business statistics courses than in online.

The hybrid conception of the field allows us to make the most of our ranging intellectual traditions and to derive research and teaching purposes that extend beyond the limits of a narrow academic legitimacy.

However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students. We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of, and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions. Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus group. Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering-/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twentythree participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using openended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently. Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings. Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs. The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt. The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them. Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.","2019","2019-07-19 20:10:29","2019-07-19 20:10:29","","","","4","121","","","""I know i have to work twice as hard and hope that makes me good enough""","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MYC9JGYN\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine this possibility, in the first study, we presented Latina women with a fictional STEM company and a scientist working at the company who was either Latino/a or a non-Latino/a White man or woman. We found that compared to those in the White man or woman scientist conditions, participants in the Latino/a scientist conditions believed the scientist had faced comparable adversity to themselves, identified more strongly with the scientist, and reported higher trust and belonging and attraction to the STEM company. Using the findings from Study 1 to inform a new intervention, in the second study we presented Latina high school students with a panel of Latina scientists. Relative to before the panel, the students reported enhanced feelings of trust and belonging in STEM after the panel. Exploratory analyses further revealed that among Latina students who did not already intend to pursue a career in STEM, the panel encouraged their interest in the sciences. Across both studies, we found that believing the scientists had past experiences with adversity related to stronger identification with the scientists, and identifying with scientists correlated with more trust and belonging and interest in STEM environments.

Narrative accounts from qualitative interviews and focus groups with women students of color enrolled in CS at a university located in the southwestern region of the US illustrate the situated ways in which participants materialized these discourses in their personal accounts of ‘not seeing and seeing women in CS.’ Participants accounts reveal how isolation, exclusion, and connection in CS are contextual, contingent, and intersectional experiences that cannot be collapsed into a single, monolithic meta-narrative. Participant accounts also demonstrate the complex ways that women students of color in CS pushed back on dominant discourses of underrepresentation and gender difference.","2019-06-26","2019-07-19 20:15:39","2019-07-19 20:15:39","2019-07-19 20:15:39","1-14","","0","0","","","Nuancing the discourse of underrepresentation","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6FTBHU5I\Convertino - 2019 - Nuancing the discourse of underrepresentation a f.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BXUW67CD\09540253.2019.html","","","computer science education; Gender inequality; discourse; feminist post-structuralism; Latinx students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two large field experiments provide estimates of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive cues on women's and men's enrollment behaviors in an online learning environment. First, a gender-inclusive photo and statement in an online advertisement for a STEM course increased the click-through rate among women but not men by 26% (N=209,000). Second, an inclusivity statement with a gender-inclusive course image to the enrollment page raised the proportion of women enrolling in a STEM course by up to 18% (N=63,000).

Disparities in opportunities for women to contribute to research metrics, such as distinguished speaker events and authorship, have been reported in many fields in the U.S.A. and Europe. However, whether female representation in scientific contributions differs in other regions, such as Latin America, is not well understood. In this study, in order to determine whether female authorship is influenced by gender or institutional location of the last (senior) author or by subfield within ecology, we gathered author information from 6849 articles in ten ecological and zoological journals that publish research articles either in or out of Latin America. We found that female authorship has risen marginally since 2002 (27 to 31%), and varies among Latin American countries, but not between Latin America and other regions. Last author gender predicted female co-authorship across all journals and regions, as research groups led by women published with over 60% female co-authors whereas those led by men published with less than 20% female co-authors. Our findings suggest that implicit biases and stereotype threats that women face in male-led laboratories could be sources of female withdrawal and leaky pipelines in ecology and zoology. Accordingly, we encourage every PI to self-evaluate their lifetime percentage of female coauthors. Female role models and cultural shifts–especially by male senior authors–are crucial for female retention and unbiased participation in science. © 2019 Salerno et al.

The academy shapes and is shaped by knowledge produced within it. As such, the production of scientific knowledge can be described as part of a socially constructed system. Like all socially constructed systems, scientific knowledge production is influenced by gender. This study investigated one layer of this system through an analysis of journal editors' understanding of if and how gender influences editorial practices in peer reviewed health science journals. The study involved two stages: 1) exploratory in-depth qualitative interviews with editors at health science journals; and 2) a nominal group technique (NGT) with experts working on gender in research, academia and the journal peer review process. Our findings indicate that some editors had not considered the impact of gender on their editorial work. Many described how they actively strive to be ‘gender blind,’ as this was seen as a means to be objective. This view fails to recognize how broader social structures operate to produce systemic inequities. None of the editors or publishers in this study were collecting gender or other social indicators as part of the article submission process. These findings suggest that there is room for editors and publishers to play a more active role in addressing structural inequities in academic publishing to ensure a diversity of knowledge and ideas are reflected.","2019-08-01","2019-07-19 20:24:15","2019-07-19 20:24:16","2019-07-19 20:24:15","112388","","","235","","Social Science & Medicine","“I don't see gender”","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>done</p>","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6QHA7GPR\Lundine et al. - 2019 - “I don't see gender” Conceptualizing a gendered s.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WAL5I3WF\S0277953619303739.html","","","Peer review; Publishing; Feminist science studies; Gender inequity; Health sciences; Journalology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They also found that STEM academic programs had a more significant negative impact on both female and male students of color and on white women. To help limit the number of students leaving STEM, it is worthwhile to consider incorporating elements of Albert Bandura's self-efficacy model into the physics classroom. Self-efficacy theory is concerned with an individual's beliefs about his or her personal capabilities to organize and execute a course of action to accomplish designated goals or performances. Bandura's self-efficacy model provides a comprehensive framework to organize physics pedagogical practice with a goal of creating an equitable learning environment and build self-confidence while increasing the students' understanding of physics concepts. © 2019 Author(s).","2019","2019-07-19 20:26:28","2019-07-24 14:44:24","","","","","2109","","","","","","","","AIP Publishing","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NEUUIEHW\Richardson - 2019 - Developing self-efficacy in the physics classroom .pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\8U7UZY8G\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AIP Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is important to examine the occurrence and impact of sexual harassment on women in physics. A survey of undergraduate women, who attended a conference for undergraduate women in physics, revealed that approximately three quarters (74.3%; 338/455) of survey respondents experienced at least one type of sexual harassment. This sample was recruited from a large fraction of undergraduate women in physics in the United States. We find that certain types of sexual harassment predict a negative sense of belonging and exacerbate the imposter phenomenon. The types of sexual harassment that predict these outcomes, both forms of gender harassment, while seemingly less severe types of harassment, have been found to have substantially negative personal and professional consequences. These findings are important since prior work has found that sense of belonging and the imposter phenomenon are related to students' persistence in STEM fields. Our results have implications for understanding and improving persistence in physics by informing the community about the occurrence of sexual harassment and its effects so that we can begin to work towards reducing its occurrence and mitigating its effects. © 2019 authors.

Participants were 79 undergraduate women in California (46% Asian, 32% Latina, 14% white) who were randomly assigned to embody a future self either highly successful in pSTEM or highly successful in humanities. Following the virtual experience, women in the pSTEM condition differed significantly from women in the humanities condition regarding pSTEM value beliefs, anticipated stereotype threat, course motivation, and women-pSTEM implicit associations, after controlling for prior pSTEM-self implicit associations. However, this difference only occurred among women who identified with the experience. While women with high identification demonstrated an effect in the desired direction, women with low identification demonstrated reactance in the opposite direction.

Yet, many women and minority students come from “high-context” cultural backgrounds. They find communal work, flexibility in time, and nonlinear and contexted learning to be salient to their academic experience. In this article, we suggest that a shift in the academic culture is needed to further advance the inclusion of more women and underrepresented minorities, as well as many majority males who have tendencies toward high-context approaches to learning. Through the application of multicontext theory and context diversity concepts, we propose that academic culture can be broadened to value the full spectrum of context orientation, and academic communities like the geosciences can develop approaches and create environments that build on the different cultural strengths of all students.

Not all faculty experience an even playing field in trying to access professional legitimacy. This is especially true for women, underrepresented minority (URM), and nontenure- track (NTT) faculty. These groups experience common dilemmas in their pursuit of professional legitimacy in research university environments, though each group also faces distinct challenges of its own. An ideal place to understand experiences of faculty trying to earn professional legitimacy are faculty learning communities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze how women, URM, and NTT faculty understand and describe professional legitimacy in one research university. We sought to understand the challenges these groups experienced in trying to obtain legitimacy from colleagues that they attributed to their gender, race, or appointment type. Through this study, we hope to provide an understanding of and recommendations for creating inclusive academic work environments for all three groups. Setting: The study took place at Land Grant University (LGU), a research-intensive institution. LGU received a National Science Foundation ADVANCE grant to focus on issues of equity in the retention and advancement of women and URM faculty. Out of recognition that the institution faced challenges in retaining and/or advancing women, URM, and NTT faculty, LGU's ADVANCE program created faculty learning communities. Research Design: A qualitative case study approach was used to understand how women, URM, and NTT faculty interpreted institutional scripts of legitimacy within their academic departments. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected using semistructured participant observations of five faculty learning communities, which were formed to support the retention and advancement of women, URM, and NTT faculty over five years. Findings/Results: Women, URM, and NTT faculty participating in faculty learning communities understood professional legitimacy as associated with belonging, merit, autonomy, and voice in decision making. Participants described multiple ways in which they felt their gender, race, and/or appointment type constrained their ability to achieve legitimacy. Conclusions and Recommendations: In this study, we used our findings to ""mark"" how inequality is maintained through professional interactions with colleagues. Implicit bias influenced several of the inequalities and barriers to earning legitimacy noted in the study. One recommendation, therefore, is to raise awareness of implicit bias and provide department-wide trainings on how to address it. This study also supports the use of faculty learning communities as a place of restoration for faculty seeking professional legitimacy and as a tool to create inclusive academic environments. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.","2018","2019-07-22 16:19:54","2019-07-22 16:19:54","","","","12","121","","","Earning professional legitimacy","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BNLEPN7D\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a series of interviews with 17 undergraduate students from a Hispanic majority institution regarding their participation in STEM-focused summer research programs at nine universities. Differences in levels of comfort in relationships were present when comparing men and women. Women students expressed comfort in relationships with mentors who provided psychosocial mentoring, were available to answer questions, and were of the same gender; they expressed some social discomfort in informal interactions with mentors. Men students felt comfortable with mentors who provided limited guidance, little psychosocial mentoring, and opportunities for informal interactions. In terms of peer relationships, women sought out the confidence of a few similar peers, while men were comfortable with a wide variety of peers. Men’s greater comfort with social relationships seemed to reflect their affinity with the masculine-dominated culture of STEM. For women, cultivating safe spaces through relationships with supportive peers and working with same-gender faculty mentors seemed to mitigate some of the discomforting aspects of their STEM research experiences.","2019-04-26","2019-07-22 16:22:57","2019-07-22 16:22:57","2019-07-22 16:22:57","ar17","","2","18","","LSE","Navigating Social Relationships with Mentors and Peers","","","","","","","","","","","","lifescied.org (Atypon)","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\5CCGK9ID\Daniels et al. - 2019 - Navigating Social Relationships with Mentors and P.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\RGCY9KVH\cbe.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use licensed data from the U.S. National Science Foundation to examine the impacts of collaboration cosmopolitanism on the job satisfaction and salary of bachelor-level science professionals. The concept of collaboration cosmopolitanism (Bozeman and Corley in Research Policy, 33(4), 599–616, 2004) pertains to various aspects of institutional and geographic distance in collaboration. We found that STEM college graduates having double-majored or minored in other fields tend to have higher levels of collaboration cosmopolitanism. We also found a significant positive relationship between collaboration cosmopolitanism and career outcomes. Women with STEM bachelor’s degrees are paid less than men, but women engaging in higher collaboration cosmopolitanism enjoy more benefits towards career outcomes than do men.

This paper tracks an exemplary case in a makerspace to theorize, describe, and analyze the behavioral patterns of young women as they engage in making and move toward expertise in STEM. Building on a material-based and constructionist notion of making, we use mediated discourse analysis to examine how recognition (materialized in artifacts as displaying, legitimizing, and circulating emergent STEM expertise) leads to transformational development over time. We introduce the notion of tinkering with development, which conceptualizes playful project design, spatial project placements, and emergent online project sharing as drivers of human developmental trajectories. Implications of this work include a set of design principles to support makerspaces and other constructionist learning environments to foster participation in STEM.

Some departments are more successful at recruiting and retaining female students than others. To understand why, we investigated potential differences between more and less successful geoscience departments in terms of social support, institutional supports, institutional barriers, perceived connection to instructors, and transformative experiences. We collected data from 2,041 undergraduate geoscience students enrolled in six geoscience departments at public, four-year institutions across the United States. We recruited two departments that were successful at graduating a high percentage of female students compared to the national average (high-success sites), two departments with a moderate percentage (medium-success sites), and two with a low percentage (low-success sites). Students at high-success sites reported greater institutional supports, greater perceived connection to instructors, and lower institutional barriers than did students at medium- and low-success sites. Nonmajors at high-success sites reported higher levels of transformative experience than nonmajors at low-success sites. No significant differences were found between medium- and low-success sites. Across all sites, female students perceived less of a connection to their instructors and endorsed a lower level of transformative experience than did male students. We did not find gender differences in terms of the other factors. We also did not find gender by site interactions, suggesting that the success of high-success sites in recruiting and retaining women was associated with supporting all students. These results suggest departments can increase effectiveness in recruiting and retaining female student by increasing institutional supports, reducing institutional barriers, connecting with students, and fostering transformative experiences. © 2019, © 2019 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","2019","2019-07-22 16:26:24","2019-07-23 18:37:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\67IW6RBA\Pugh et al. - 2019 - A quantitative investigation of geoscience departm.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\HN4VGFG2\display.html; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BTL7LXJE\10899995.2019.html","","","retention; Gender; geoscience education; social cognitive career theory; STEM pipeline","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that grade point averages in STEM courses would be higher in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. Furthermore, we tested competing hypotheses about the moderating role of belonging to either a well-represented (WR) or underrepresented minority (URM) ethnic group in STEM. Method: The sample (N = 199) included 115 women from WR ethnic groups and 84 women from URM ethnic groups who were randomly assigned to condition. Women in the intervention were educated about the harmful impact of gender stereotypes in STEM and provided with effective strategies for coping with stereotype threat. At the end of their first year, we obtained participants’ academic transcripts. Results: At the end of their first year in college, URM women in the intervention condition had higher grade point averages in their STEM courses than URM women in the control condition. The intervention had no effect on WR women. Conclusions: The present research demonstrates the importance of intersectional approaches to studying the experiences of women in STEM.

Thus, to better understand educators rq questions and concerns about gender diversity, we conducted a qualitative exploratory study within an online discussion forum, Stack Exchange for CS educators. The conversations gave us insights into gender diversity issues that the forum members were interested in, such as enrollment, retention, and roles of teachers.

We wanted to know if the explanations Margolis and Fisher found were applicable for students in a more typical CS program in 2017, so we conducted a study to investigate the home and pre-college experiences of students who are currently majoring in CS or Computer Engineering (CE), and these students' pathway into computing majors. We recruited 11 participants from a large public institution in the Midwest U.S., and conducted interviews of these students using a protocol adapted from UTC. We performed a qualitative iterative and inductive analysis of these interviews and found that while technology access had greatly improved, views and attitudes were much slower to change. We discovered that fathers preferentially teaching sons about computing, while less prevalent than it was in UTC, still occurs. We also found that the participants, including the women, had more diverse pathways into computing than what Margolis and Fisher found.

Pair programming is demonstrably beneficial in many ways, and we hypothesize that there are gender differences in student perceptions of this widely used collaboration framework. To explore these differences and move toward a thorough understanding of students' experiences, this paper investigates students' written responses about their experiences with pair programming in a university-level introductory computer science course. Using thematic analysis, we identified overarching themes and distinguished between what men and women reported. Both women and men wrote about their overwhelmingly positive perceptions of pair programming. Women often mentioned that pair programming helps with engagement, feeling less frustrated, building confidence, and making friends. Women also noted that it is easier to learn from peers. These findings shed light on how pair programming may lower barriers to women's participation and retention in computing and inform ongoing efforts to create more inclusive spaces in computing education.","2019","2019-07-22 18:46:13","2019-07-22 18:46:13","2019-07-22 18:46:13","1053–1059","","","","","","In Their Own Words","SIGCSE '19","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","event-place: Minneapolis, MN, USA","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\R5SSQNV3\Ying et al. - 2019 - In Their Own Words Gender Differences in Student .pdf","","","gender; undergraduate education; pair programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a pilot study (N = 167; Mage = 20.1 years), women who completed a manipulation of stereotype threat (a socially evaluative math task in front of male evaluators) experienced greater subjective threat than did men. In Studies 1A and 1B, math-identified female undergraduates completed the stereotype threat or control (doing math alone) manipulation and then completed a collaborative math task with another female or male student (who completed the control task). Sympathetic nervous system responses were collected to measure physiological linkage—the effect of participants’ physiological states on their partners’ subsequent physiological states—as an indicator of attention to the partner. We also measured the number of math-related questions participants asked their partners and task performance. In Study 1A (female-female dyads; N = 104; Mage = 19.9 years), threatened women asked more questions than controls did and became physiologically linked to their partners when those partners were speaking about math. Threatened women performed comparably to controls.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of major switching, looking at the patterns of switching in both academic and non-academic dimensions. Low grades signal academic mismatch and predict switching majors - and the lower the grades, the larger the switch in terms of course content. Surprisingly, these switches do not improve students’ grades. When students switch majors, they switch to majors that “look like them”: females to female-heavy majors, and so on. Lower-ability women flee competitive majors at high rates, while men and higher-ability women are undeterred. Women are far more likely to leave STEM fields for majors that are less competitive – but still somewhat science-intensive – suggesting that leaving STEM may be more about fleeing the “culture” of STEM majors than fleeing science and math.","2019-06-01","2019-07-22 18:49:45","2019-07-22 18:49:45","2019-07-22 18:49:45","75-93","","","70","","Economics of Education Review","Are changes of major major changes?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\6M5S57FM\Astorne-Figari and Speer - 2019 - Are changes of major major changes The roles of g.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\S2TN2PK9\S0272775718304680.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be due to problematic messaging in gateway courses such as (a) mismatches between students’ cultural norms and those of the learning context and (b) fixed ideas about ability as unchangeable. The current study investigated how culturally relevant growth messages impacted help-seeking behavior and grades in a gateway STEM course. Undergraduate students (168 men, 285 women) were randomly assigned to receive an email invitation to a peer-led tutoring program that included factual information (control), growth messages, or culture-matching growth messages emphasizing effort and interdependence. Tutoring sign-ups, number of sessions attended, and grades were collected. Path analyses showed no impact of messaging on men’s sign-ups. Yet, growth messages increased women’s sign-ups relative to the control, which led to more sessions attended and, subsequently, higher course grades. Unexpectedly, the culture-matching growth condition decreased sign-ups for women. Follow-up exploratory survey data on students from the course (161 men, 268 women) revealed that more women perceived peer interactions as competitive than men, which may shed light on the unexpected findings. Programs should implement growth messages to recruit more women and to improve collaboration in peer-learning settings.","2019-04-01","2019-07-22 18:54:15","2019-07-22 18:54:15","2019-07-22 18:54:15","434-451","","3","22","","Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\V899W8TQ\Covarrubias et al. - 2019 - Growth messages increase help-seeking and performa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, women’s team identification and collective efficacy mediate the relationship between the percentage of women on the team and overall team performance. Interestingly, the number of men on the team did not influence men’s sense of team identification, collective efficacy, or team performance. This research has implications for team composition. Specifically, when navigating diversity in teams, managers and leaders should aim to build teams that are composed of multiple women versus an approach that divides women up among various teams.

It draws on theories of learning and equity from the learning sciences to inform the understanding of women’s underrepresentation in computing as it investigates young women who showed an interest in computing in high school and followed-up with them in their college and careers.,The mixed-methods approach compares data from quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups and interviews. The sample comes from database of 1,500 young women who expressed interest in computing by applying for an award for high schoolers. These women were surveyed in 2013 and then again in 2016, with 511 women identifying themselves as high schoolers in 2013 and then having graduated and pursued college or careers in the second survey. The authors also conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with 90 women from the same sample.,The findings show that multiple factors influence women’s persistence in computing, but the best predictor of women’s persistence is access to early computing and programming opportunities. However, access and opportunities must be evaluated within broader social and contextual factors.,The main limitation is that the authors measure women’s persistence in computing according to their chosen major or profession. This study does not measure the impact of computational thinking in women’s everyday lives.,Educators and policymakers should consider efforts to make Computer Science-for-All a reality.,Few longitudinal studies of a large sample of women exist that follow women interested in computing from high school into college and careers particularly from a critical educational equity perspective.","2019-05-13","2019-07-22 18:57:17","2019-07-22 18:57:17","2019-07-22 18:57:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","world","www.emerald.com","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ZV28RAEG\html.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The STEPS program has served thousands of youth over the past two decades to provide academic support and mentoring to minorities and women students. The STEPS program focuses on demonstrating a connected learning approach to STEM academics. Students participate in mentoring through the STEM pipeline of course choices, extra-curricular activities, and exposure to STEM practitioners.

While most faculty and scientists believe that they are fair and unbiased, numerous well-designed studies published in leading peer-reviewed journals show that gender bias in sciences and medicine is widespread and persistent today in both faculty and students. Recent studies show that gender bias affects student grading, professional hiring, mentoring, tenure, promotion, respect, grant proposal success, and pay. In addition, sexual harassment remains a significant barrier. Fortunately, several studies provide evidence that programs that raise conscious awareness of gender bias can improve equity in science, and there are a number of recommendations and strategies for improving the participation of women.","2019-08-21","2019-08-19 20:24:40","2019-08-19 20:24:42","2019-08-19 20:24:40","e00018-19","","3","83","","Microbiol.

At both the WLE Conference and the UCEA Conference, we heard frustration from veteran women in the field that the study of women in leadership is stagnant and has not moved forward in several years; with scholars new to the field continuing to write and publish work about barriers to aspiring and practicing women leaders (the same types of reports that began the'formal'inquiry into women's lives as leaders back in the 1980s) without being able to push forward with'new'information or ideas for change. In essence, the concerns and questions that were posed from some veteran women were: Why are we continuing to report the same things that we reported 30 years ago?; Why are we still talking about barriers to women in leadership?; and Why haven't we moved past gender binaries in regard to leadership ideas and practice? Considering these questions, some women new to the field countered with their own set of responses and questions that included: Is it not significant to report that some women are still experiencing the same types of barriers in leadership that were highlighted 30 years ago?; Is it accurate to report that all women's voices have now been heard/represented?; and How can we report something different if it hasn't happened? The discussions that have ensued between veteran women and those new to the field inspired us to develop a book that situates women in leadership exactly where we are today (and reports the status of girls who are positioned to continue the'good fight'that began many years ago) and that both highlights the changes that have occurred and reports any stagnancy that continues to threaten women's positionality in educational leadership literature, practice, and policy. It forefronts the voices of women educational scholars who have (and are) interrupting, disrupting, and revolutionizing educational policy and practice. Our book reports women's leadership activities and knowledge in both the k-12 and university settings and concludes with chapters ripe with ideas for pushing for change through policy, advocacy, and activism. The final chapter presents themes that emerged from the individual chapters and sets forth an agenda to move forward with the study of women in leadership.","2014","2019-10-21 15:25:14","2019-10-21 15:25:14","2019-10-21 15:25:14","","","","","","","","Educational Leadership for Social Justice","","","","Information Age Publishing","Charlotte, North Carolina","English","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","EDUCATION / General; Feminism and education; Women--Education (Higher)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After failing to close a historically documented gender gap in a large introductory biology course using interventions targeted at training a growth mindset, we implemented interventions designed to reduce student test anxiety. We combined evidence-based exercises based on expressive writing and on reappraising physiological arousal. We also used a valid measure to quantify test anxiety at the start and end of the course. This instrument measures an individual’s self-declared or perceived test anxiety—also called trait anxiety—but not the immediate or “state” anxiety experienced during an actual exam. Consistent with previous reports in the literature, we found that women in this population declared much higher test anxiety than men and that students who declared higher test anxiety had lower exam scores than students who declared lower test anxiety. Although the test anxiety interventions had no impact on the level of self-declared trait anxiety, they did significantly increase student exam performance. The treatment benefits occurred in both men and women. These data suggest that 1) a combination of interventions based on expressive writing and reappraising physiological arousal can be a relatively easy manner to boost exam performance in a large-enrollment science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) course and encourage emotion regulation; 2) women are more willing than men to declare that they are anxious about exams, but men and women may actually experience the same level of anxiety during the exam itself; and 3) women are underperforming in STEM courses for reasons other than gender-based differences in mindset or test anxiety. © 2019 R.

While considerable work has identified the individual cognitive and external systemic factors that influence math achievement, less is known about personality-like traits that might contribute to success in mathematics, especially among women. This study examines two such traits: systemizing – the tendency to analyze systems and extract underlying rules that govern its behavior – and empathizing – the ability to identify with another’s emotions and respond appropriately. Recently Escovar, Rosenberg-Lee, Uddin, and Menon [Scientific Reports, 6, 23011 (2016)] found that empathizing was a negative predictor of math skills in children, especially among girls, suggesting that women with higher empathy might be particularly disposed to lower math performance. In the first study 142 participants (71 female) completed two standardized measures of math achievement and questionnaires to gauge the tendency to empathize and systemize. Surprisingly, higher empathy was associated with better math performance in women, while men displayed the expected pattern of lower empathy being related to higher math scores. In a second study, we extend this finding in women (n = 121) to show that individuals who report higher mathematics achievement in university level course work also have higher empathy scores. Further, while positive attitudes towards mathematics tended to decline from elementary school to college, women whose attitudes increased had higher empathy scores than those who declined. Together these results suggest that while the tendency to empathize is associated with worse math performance in childhood, it may become a protective factor as women progress through their mathematics education.","2019","2019-11-05 21:37:07","2019-11-05 21:37:07","2019-11-05 21:37:07","","","","10","","Front.

This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners' avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Specifically, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) × 2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our findings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women's learning outcomes in virtual classrooms.

Given the inherent difficulty in identifying and measuring the perceptions of subtle gender biases, this index provides researchers and interventionists with a tool that does not require participants to identify/label an event as a gender bias incident. We used a mixed method and constructivist approach that prioritized and privileged the voices and experiences of women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM). The current article describes two studies: (1) index development and (2) index refinement and validation, using a national survey of women academics (N = 882). Findings support a four-subscale structure, including perceived gender inequity, collegiality, mentorship, and institutional support.

Conceptualizing STEM as a monolithic category, rather than as a combination of distinct fields, prevents researchers from understanding and documenting the full range of persistent inequality within scientific disciplines at the graduate level and throughout the lifespan. The purpose of this paper is to address two oversights prior to degree completion within the context of the USA by asking two specific questions: To what extent is gender associated with choice of discipline within STEM graduate education? In the USA, do gender differences in STEM fields depend on citizenship status? Design/methodology/approach Using data from the 2015 International STEM Graduate Student in the US Survey, this study employs multinomial logistic regression analyses and presents predicted probabilities to assess differences of enrollment in STEM fields by gender and citizenship status. Findings Results show that domestic women were less likely to enroll in computer sciences and engineering when compared to domestic men. However, in contrast to domestic students, there were no gender differences among international students’ enrollment in engineering. Research limitations/implications This paper shows the importance and complexity of how gender intersects with citizenship status in enrollment patterns in STEM graduate fields. The survey included the top 10 universities in the USA based on the total enrollment of international students, and it is unclear if there exists differences in these selected students and schools when compared to students at colleges and universities that enroll less international graduate students. Originality/value The author makes the case to disaggregate STEM to better assess how specific fields can be modified to attract graduate students worldwide. This paper accentuates the significance of gender and citizenship status for understanding differences in choice of discipline among graduate students in STEM.","2019-01-01","2019-11-05 21:25:13","2019-11-05 21:25:15","2019-11-05 21:25:13","","","ahead-of-print","ahead-of-print","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\YQQTWGPR\html.html","","","STEM; Gender; Higher education; Citizenship status; Graduate education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge management studies inefficiencies in information sharing within organizations and proposes solutions. In the academic library, the one-shot library instruction session is largely inadequate in teaching students how to use library databases, particularly for advanced assignments. Follow-up contact such as workshops or individual instruction sessions requires time and initiative from students, and this contact very often does not occur. This denies students the opportunity to experience much of the crucial subject knowledge of the librarian. This kind of unshared subject librarian knowledge corresponds to a key concept of knowledge management called tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to both knowledge that is unshared in an organization as well as knowledge that is difficult to document and transmit. Social media platforms and course software such as LibGuides may offer a solution to enhancing librarian-student teaching, but only if the resource contains a significant amount of previously tacit knowledge (tutorials, links to explanatory reference material, course-specific search strategies, and more). A key goal for librarians should be sharing and making easily accessible previously undocumented subject-specific knowledge. This article evaluates different ways of sharing knowledge using LibGuides and social media, and how well these forms respond to the information-seeking behavior of students.","2019-12-02","2019-12-05 22:59:25","2019-12-05 22:59:25","2019-12-05 22:59:25","1-8","","0","0","","","Sharing is caring","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\TXLXYBGK\Allan - 2019 - Sharing is caring Using knowledge management to e.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MMWFNPYZ\08963568.2019.html","","","Knowledge management; one-shot instruction; tacit knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women are severely underrepresented at all levels in physics and engineering. Physics in particular has stereotypes about being a discipline for brilliant men. Therefore, it is particularly difficult for women who do not fit the description of a stereotypical physicist to develop a physics identity. Thus, understanding the factors underlying physics identity in introductory physics classrooms is important for creating an equitable and inclusive physics learning environment and has the potential to at least partly explain the current underrepresentation of women in physics-related majors and careers. In this study, we examined physics identity and several other motivational constructs of male and female students by administering a survey in introductory calculus-based physics courses at a large research university. We found gender differences in how students identify as a physics person and how their perceived recognition from others, such as their teaching assistants or instructors, peers, or family members relates to their physics identities. We tested separate models by gender that examined how different motivational constructs relate to students’ physics identities. We found that the perception of being recognized by influential others such as the course instructor or teaching assistants was differentially related to female and male students’ physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging in the physics classroom. These findings call for improving the physics learning environments to make them equitable so that all students have a high sense of belonging and self-efficacy and opportunity to develop a strong physics identity.","2019-08-27","2019-12-09 22:56:15","2019-12-09 22:56:15","2019-12-09 22:56:15","020119","","2","15","","Phys.

It is important to quantify gender differences in subdomains of scientific work in order to detect potential biases and monitor progress. In this work, we study the relevance of gender in scientific collaboration patterns in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), a professional society with sixteen peer-reviewed journals. Using their publication data from 1952 to 2016, we constructed a large temporal bipartite network between authors and publications, and augmented the author nodes with gender labels. We characterized differences in several basic statistics of this network over time, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical events. We find a steady increase in participation by women (e.g., fraction of authorships by women and of new women authors) starting around 1980. However, women still comprise less than 25% of the INFORMS society and an even smaller fraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe a methodology for quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the overall connectivity of the network, using it to measure subtle differences between authorships by women and by men. Specifically, as measures of structural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and contraction importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network. As a null model, we propose a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network model with emergent communities. Our results suggest the presence of systematic differences between the collaboration patterns of men and women that cannot be explained by only local statistics. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2019-12-16 16:32:08","2019-12-16 16:32:12","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\AG3EASYS\Bravo-Hermsdorff et al. - 2019 - Gender and collaboration patterns in a temporal sc.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\I7F2QWIB\display.html","","","Authorship network; Collaboration patterns; Gender in STEM; Temporal network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These bibliometric studies not only focused on publication output and impact, but also on cross-referencing output, promotions and tenure data, and other related curriculum vitae (CV) information.

While authorship historically has been attributed to individuals and small groups, thereby making it relatively easy to tell who made major contributions to the work, recent collaborations have involved hundreds or thousands of individuals. Printing all of these names in the author list on articles can mean difficulties in discerning the nature or extent of individual contributions, which has significant implications for hiring and promotion procedures. This also can make collaborative research less attractive to scientists at the outset of a project. I discuss the issues that physicists are considering as they grapple with what it means to be “an author,” in addition to suggesting that future work in this area draw on the emerging economics literature on “mechanism design” in considering how credit can be attributed in ways that both ensure proper attribution and induce scientists to put forth their best effort.","2006","2019-12-17 15:31:11","2019-12-17 15:31:11","2019-12-17 15:31:11","1758-1770","","13","57","","","What does it mean to be an author?","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\T2HPJFMH\Birnholtz - 2006 - What does it mean to be an author The intersectio.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\ZHX7ZRG5\asi.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Joining museum curatorial staffs and professional associations that were largely male, these women educators and their peers typically provided pedagogical insights and teaching skills that enabled them to work effectively with school systems, teachers, pupils and parents. Genuinely interested in natural science, they shaped careers which included opportunities to engage with science, provided a considerable degree of autonomy and enabled them to experiment with hands-on learning. They built networks of museum educators and influenced the young American Association of Museums.

Through a mix of curiosity, serendipity, and perseverance, feminist scholars began revealing the sheer prevalence of women scientists, both historical and contemporary. Bystydzienski and Bird called attention to the slow progress of interventions to reverse the underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the United States.

Among the ways to encourage females to pursue STEM careers are outreach programs offered by schools and universities. This manuscript reviews the implementation of a novel program, the Women in Science Experience (WISE), a STEM-focused residential summer camp for high school females, located on the campus of a small university in the USA. Upon the conclusion of WISE, participants were asked to respond to a series of open-ended questions about their perceptions of science and science careers. Using thematic analysis, responses were coded and organized. Three themes emerged from this analysis. Love of Science showed how WISE participants appreciate science. Aspirations for Success resulted from career and life interests. Impact of WISE demonstrated how students’ experiences at WISE affected future goals. The findings from this article speak to ongoing debates about how to maintain interest in STEM fields by females in secondary and post-secondary education.","2019-12-21","2020-01-06 17:36:57","2020-01-06 17:37:00","2020-01-06 17:36:57","","","","","","Int J of Sci and Math Educ","“I Love Science”","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\NRJNKK6V\Bindis - 2019 - “I Love Science” Opinions of Secondary School Fem.pdf","","","Secondary education; Qualitative research; Gender and STEM; Informal science education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using interviews and narrative to capture her first-hand perspective as a woman engineer of color, peer support was revealed as a dominantfactor in her attainment of a PhD in engineering. The two counter-stories presented are related to positive and negative peer support in STEM. These narratives serve as valid evidence for one woman's experiences in STEM and emphasize the role of race and racism on peer networks and STEM success. Though showing this one case, the findings have implications for how higher education institutions can provide structures where supportive peer networks can emerge to support women of color and students of color in STEM.","2019","2020-01-06 17:39:39","2020-01-06 17:39:39","2020-01-06 17:39:39","181-193","","2","88","","Journal of Negro Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","STEM education; Women engineers; Education of African American women; Peers; Racism in education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diversity enhancement initiatives frequently attempt to mitigate skill deficits such as math skills in an attempt to improve preparedness of these students. However, such interventions do not address cultural or social barriers that contribute to the isolation and marginalization that discourage continued participation in STEM. Science exists and is developed within social constructs.; because of this, cultural conflicts can occur pertaining to contrasting cultural belief systems between educators and students, or to socially-biased perspectives that are embedded in disciplinary values. These conflicts are implicated in the low recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in STEM. To address the relationship between culture and STEM diversity, I present a case study that examines the role of culturally-biased views of nature on the lack of diverse participation in ecology and environmental biology. I conclude by advocating the use of inclusive, culturally-sensitive teaching practices that can improve the climate for underrepresented students and increase diverse recruitment and retention in STEM.","2019-12","2020-01-06 17:40:23","2020-01-06 17:40:23","2020-01-06 17:40:23","291","","4","9","","","Nature in the Eye of the Beholder","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KRYM7GWU\Miriti - 2019 - Nature in the Eye of the Beholder A Case Study fo.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\PPSFD2MU\291.html","","","Anglo-Eurocentrism; biocultural homogenization; cultural competence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Higher education leaders must be more intentional in broadening the participation of women and people of color in STEM. Both groups comprise a large and growing segment of U.S. postsecondary enrollment. Women comprise the majority population within all U.S. colleges and universities, and students of color comprise almost 40%. Yet, neither of these groups is represented at these same levels in STEM degree completion. Significant underrepresentation continues in STEM undergraduate and doctoral attainment, as well as in faculty and leadership representation. The nation’s minority-serving institutions (MSIs)—and especially Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)—have demonstrated remarkable success in graduating underrepresented minority men and women in STEM and in sending many on to acquire STEM doctoral degrees. This chapter makes the case that success in broadening higher education STEM participation requires informed and committed leadership that is centered within the cultural contexts of the institutions and communities represented within their student bodies. We further argue that the leadership competencies required to advance broadening participation in STEM can be developed or enhanced through the implementation of formal professional development initiatives. Detailed attention will be placed on selected NSF-funded leadership development endeavors. As the results of such efforts are communicated to the higher education community, HBCUs and other MSIs can move from the margins to the center of STEM higher education reform.","2019-01-01","2020-01-06 17:43:32","2020-01-06 17:43:32","2020-01-06 17:43:32","177-195","","","1328","0","","Leadership Dimensions for Broadening Participation in STEM","ACS Symposium Series","1328","","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","DOI: 10.1021/bk-2019-1328.ch012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, studies addressing gender inequity in science often ignore a large source of undergraduate science degree earners: those who enroll in science courses intending to pursue careers in health or medicine. This study examines pathways toward or away from science degrees in N = 4,345 men and women enrolled in early science courses at a large undergraduate research university. Importantly, to understand shifts in students' academic intentions and how pathways to science may be differential by gender, this study analyzed students' incoming major and career intentions, estimates of incoming academic abilities, and relative performance in science and various non-science courses. Results show that while men and women initially intending to pursue a science major graduate with science degrees in equal numbers, the plurality of science degree earners are students entering college intending health or medical careers. Further, from those subgroups, a significantly larger proportion of men end up in science, while a significantly larger proportion of women end up outside of STEM completely. Understanding disciplinary differences in gender barriers to science participation can help inform interventions that specifically target those populations.","","2020-01-08 21:09:52","2020-01-08 21:09:57","2020-01-08 21:09:52","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\94PMLKLV\Witherspoon and Schunn - Locating and understanding the largest gender diff.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\Q63CX55P\sce.html","","","gender; retention; science education; equity; medical education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students who fail at medical school may be more likely to struggle in professional practice, therefore helping individuals overcome problems and respond appropriately is important. There is little understanding about what factors influence how individuals experience failure or make sense of the failing experience in remediation. The aim of this study was to investigate the complexity surrounding the failure experience from the student’s perspective using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Methods The accounts of three medical students who had failed final re-sit exams, were subjected to in-depth analysis using IPA methodology. IPA was used to analyse each transcript case-by-case allowing the researcher to make sense of the participant’s subjective world. The analysis process allowed the complexity surrounding the failure to be highlighted, alongside a narrative describing how students made sense of the experience. Results The circumstances surrounding students as they approached assessment and experienced failure at finals were a complex interaction between academic problems, personal problems (specifically finance and relationships), strained relationships with friends, family or faculty, and various mental health problems. Each student experienced multi-dimensional issues, each with their own individual combination of problems, but experienced remediation as a one-dimensional intervention with focus only on improving performance in written exams. What these students needed to be included was help with clinical skills, plus social and emotional support. Fear of termination of the their course was a barrier to open communication with staff. Conclusions These students’ experience of failure was complex. The experience of remediation is influenced by the way in which students make sense of failing. Generic remediation programmes may fail to meet the needs of students for whom personal, social and mental health issues are a part of the picture.","2015-05-12","2020-01-22 19:08:48","2020-01-22 19:08:48","2020-01-22 19:08:48","","","","15","","BMC Med Educ","Medical students’ personal experience of high-stakes failure","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25964102 PMCID: PMC4548844","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\MBPR4J9W\Patel et al. - 2015 - Medical students’ personal experience of high-stak.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548844/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More attention to their use in formal evaluation settings raises questions about SP characteristics for “high‐stakes”; testing. Institutions contemplating the use of SPs in tests that “count""—whether they are medical schools or test agencies—need to examine a complex of new issues related to this intended use. This article discusses what some of these issues are and proposes some benefits to be gained by the schools and the licensing bodies by addressing this complex of issues in a collaborative way. The effort to develop a common set of processes to deal with the development and administration of SP tests could lay the groundworkfor a common clinical evaluation system that would efficiently serve both education and licensure requirements while safeguarding their autonomous interests. The current Standardized Patient Project at the National Board of Medical Examiners serves as an example of this collaborative approach.","1994-01-01","2020-01-22 19:09:40","2020-01-22 19:09:40","2020-01-22 19:09:40","28-32","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\KTV6JL3C\10401339409539639.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When faced with uncertainties in a new curriculum, confidence in achieving academic goals may be threatened. We previously found associations between academic performance and pride, hope, anxiety, and shame in medical students. Are these emotions still associated in the context of an evolving curriculum? Approach: All 1st- and 2nd-year medical students were invited to participate in a survey study (n = 264). Year 1 students were in the first semester of the new curriculum. The Hope, Pride, Shame, and Anxiety subscales of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) General Survey for Students were administered in fall 2017. Academic performance (semester overall percentage) was matched to participants completing all 4 questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the results. Findings: Response rates for those who completed every survey administered was 18.5%. Combined data from the classes revealed relationships between academic performance with MBI subscale-professional efficacy (r = .577), hope (r = .497), pride (r = .411), anxiety (r = −.307), and shame (r = −.402). Upon analyzing data from each class, professional efficacy (M1: r = .535; M2: r = .674) and pride (M1: r = .591; M2: r = .450) were correlated to academic performance. In a stepwise regression model, professional efficacy was the only predictor of academic performance (B = .560, t = 3.82, R2 = .31). Insights: When faced with challenges from medical school, positive emotions strengthen self-efficacy, allowing students to identify strategies to accomplish academic goals. Although it is important to acknowledge the emotions that students experience, our finding that professional efficacy was the most significant predictor of academic performance suggests the need for strategies to enhance self-efficacy. Use of flipped classrooms or problem-based learning offers opportunities for cognitive appraisal to foster their self-efficacy.","2019-10-20","2020-01-22 19:11:16","2020-01-22 19:11:16","2020-01-22 19:11:16","479-486","","5","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","PMID: 31116577","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\WADC8VSS\Burr and Dallaghan - 2019 - The Relationship of Emotions and Burnout to Medica.pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\3CMAZ3U2\10401334.2019.html","","","achievement emotions; burnout; medical student","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To describe the implementation of a high-stakes rubric to assess student professionalism in introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs and APPEs) to promote the professional socialization of students in the doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program at Western New England University (WNE). Findings. A professionalism rubric was adapted from the literature to assess the professional behavior of students enrolled in experiential courses based on evaluation of the following criteria: appropriate communication skills with patients and providers, appearance and dress code, timeliness, and initiative. The rubric was implemented in the fall semester of 2013 as a high-stakes component of the assessment within all experiential courses. Students were required to meet expectations for each of the four criteria in order to pass the practice experience, independent of their performance in other course components. Students were assessed by their preceptors at the midpoint and end of each practice experience using the appropriate evaluation tool. Each of the IPPE and APPE evaluation tools included the professionalism rubric as a requirement for assessment. Use of the Professionalism Rubric as a high-stakes assessment tool highlighted professionalism as an important component of the program, making expectations explicit to students and providing leverage to preceptors for holding students accountable. Summary. The Office of Experiential Affairs at WNE has raised awareness of the importance of professionalism and promoted the professional socialization of PharmD students with the use of a highstakes professionalism rubric.","2017-01","2020-01-22 19:32:56","2020-01-22 19:32:56","2020-01-22 19:32:56","1-4","","1","81","","American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education","Promoting Professional Socialization Within the Experiential Curriculum","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JJ8VNPYX\Tanzer and Dintzner - 2017 - Promoting Professional Socialization Within the Ex.pdf","","","Experiential learning; Educational tests & measurements; High-stakes tests; Professional socialization; Professionalism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant fraction of contingent faculty teaches in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As an initiative of the Ecological Society of America (ESA), contingent faculty in ecology were surveyed and the results were compared with a survey of STEM faculty conducted by the Coalition for the Academic Workforce (CAW). Most respondents to the ESA survey were employed in research or research and teaching activities at doctorate-granting institutions, whereas in the CAW sample, most were engaged in teaching at associate's and master's degree-granting institutions. The ESA sample was almost evenly divided between women and men; women outnumbered men in the younger age classes, whereas men outnumbered women in the older age classes. The respondents to the CAW survey were older than the ESA respondents, with more men in computer sciences, engineering, and physical sciences, more women in the biological and health sciences, and a balanced gender ratio in mathematics. The ESA survey asked respondents to rank possible activities that ESA could undertake to support contingent faculty. The highest ranked activities included reduced fees for membership, page charges, and meeting registrations, followed closely by small grants for travel and research. The lowest ranked was the formation of an ESA section for contingent faculty. The causes and implications of contingency are analyzed in light of other recent surveys. Academic institutions and professional societies such as the ESA can reduce the loss of qualified individuals from the scientific community by recognizing and legitimizing contingency as an academic career stage and by offering professional development to support the careers of contingent faculty.","2019","2020-01-30 17:29:01","2020-01-30 17:29:06","2020-01-30 17:29:01","e02964","","12","10","","","Contingent faculty in ecology and STEM","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\JPUBN26Y\Fetcher et al. - 2019 - Contingent faculty in ecology and STEM an uneven .pdf; C:\Users\hblackburn\Zotero\storage\BXJF3MVF\ecs2.html","","","women; higher education; gender; diversity; academic career stages; adjunct faculty; Coalition for the Academic Workforce; contingent faculty; Ecological Society of America; non-tenure-track faculty; part-time faculty; professional societies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
